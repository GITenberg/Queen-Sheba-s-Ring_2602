      CHAPTER I
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE COMING OF THE RING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Every one has read the monograph, I believe that is the right word, of my
      dear friend, Professor Higgs&mdash;Ptolemy Higgs to give him his full name&mdash;descriptive
      of the tableland of Mur in North Central Africa, of the ancient
      underground city in the mountains which surrounded it, and of the strange
      tribe of Abyssinian Jews, or rather their mixed descendants, by whom it
      is, or was, inhabited. I say every one advisedly, for although the public
      which studies such works is usually select, that which will take an
      interest in them, if the character of a learned and pugnacious personage
      is concerned, is very wide indeed. Not to mince matters, I may as well
      explain what I mean at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professor Higgs&rsquo;s rivals and enemies, of whom either the brilliancy of his
      achievements or his somewhat abrupt and pointed methods of controversy
      seem to have made him a great many, have risen up, or rather seated
      themselves, and written him down&mdash;well, an individual who strains the
      truth. Indeed, only this morning one of these inquired, in a letter to the
      press, alluding to some adventurous traveller who, I am told, lectured to
      the British Association several years ago, whether Professor Higgs did
      not, in fact, ride across the desert to Mur, not upon a camel, as he
      alleged, but upon a land tortoise of extraordinary size.
    </p>
    <p>
      The innuendo contained in this epistle has made the Professor, who, as I
      have already hinted, is not by nature of a meek disposition, extremely
      angry. Indeed, notwithstanding all that I could do, he left his London
      house under an hour ago with a whip of hippopotamus hide such as the
      Egyptians call a <i>koorbash</i>, purposing to avenge himself upon the
      person of his defamer. In order to prevent a public scandal, however, I
      have taken the liberty of telephoning to that gentleman, who, bold and
      vicious as he may be in print, is physically small and, I should say, of a
      timid character, to get out of the way at once. To judge from the abrupt
      fashion in which our conversation came to an end, I imagine that the hint
      has been taken. At any rate, I hope for the best, and, as an extra
      precaution, have communicated with the lawyers of my justly indignant
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader will now probably understand that I am writing this book, not
      to bring myself or others before the public, or to make money of which I
      have no present need, or for any purpose whatsoever, except to set down
      the bare and actual truth. In fact, so many rumours are flying about as to
      where we have been and what befell us that this has become almost
      necessary. As soon as I laid down that cruel column of gibes and
      insinuations to which I have alluded&mdash;yes, this very morning, before
      breakfast, this conviction took hold of me so strongly that I cabled to
      Oliver, Captain Oliver Orme, the hero of my history, if it has any
      particular hero, who is at present engaged upon what must be an extremely
      agreeable journey round the world&mdash;asking his consent. Ten minutes
      since the answer arrived from Tokyo. Here it is:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do what you like and think necessary, but please alter all names, et
      cetera, as propose returning via America, and fear interviewers. Japan
      jolly place.&rdquo; Then follows some private matter which I need not insert.
      Oliver is always extravagant where cablegrams are concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I suppose that before entering on this narration, for the reader&rsquo;s benefit
      I had better give some short description of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My name is Richard Adams, and I am the son of a Cumberland yeoman who
      married a Welshwoman. Therefore I have Celtic blood in my veins, which
      perhaps accounts for my love of roving and other things. I am now an old
      man, near the end of my course, I suppose; at any rate, I was sixty-five
      last birthday. This is my appearance as I see it in the glass before me:
      tall, spare (I don&rsquo;t weigh more than a hundred and forty pounds&mdash;the
      desert has any superfluous flesh that I ever owned, my lot having been,
      like Falstaff, to lard the lean earth, but in a hot climate); my eyes are
      brown, my face is long, and I wear a pointed white beard, which matches
      the white hair above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth compels me to add that my general appearance, as seen in that glass
      which will not lie, reminds me of that of a rather aged goat; indeed, to
      be frank, by the natives among whom I have sojourned, and especially among
      the Khalifa&rsquo;s people when I was a prisoner there, I have often been called
      the White Goat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of my very commonplace outward self let this suffice. As for my record, I
      am a doctor of the old school. Think of it! When I was a student at
      Bart.&lsquo;s the antiseptic treatment was quite a new thing, and administered
      when at all, by help of a kind of engine on wheels, out of which
      disinfectants were dispensed with a pump, much as the advanced gardener
      sprays a greenhouse to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      I succeeded above the average as a student, and in my early time as a
      doctor. But in every man&rsquo;s life there happen things which, whatever
      excuses may be found for them, would not look particularly well in cold
      print (nobody&rsquo;s record, as understood by convention and the Pharisee,
      could really stand cold print); also something in my blood made me its
      servant. In short, having no strict ties at home, and desiring to see the
      world, I wandered far and wide for many years, earning my living as I
      went, never, in my experience, a difficult thing to do, for I was always a
      master of my trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      My fortieth birthday found me practising at Cairo, which I mention only
      because it was here that first I met Ptolemy Higgs, who, even then in his
      youth, was noted for his extraordinary antiquarian and linguistic
      abilities. I remember that in those days the joke about him was that he
      could swear in fifteen languages like a native and in thirty-two with
      common proficiency, and could read hieroglyphics as easily as a bishop
      reads the <i>Times</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I doctored him through a bad attack of typhoid, but as he had spent
      every farthing he owned on scarabs or something of the sort, made him no
      charge. This little kindness I am bound to say he never forgot, for
      whatever his failings may be (personally I would not trust him alone with
      any object that was more than a thousand years old), Ptolemy is a good and
      faithful friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Cairo I married a Copt. She was a lady of high descent, the tradition
      in her family being that they were sprung from one of the Ptolemaic
      Pharaohs, which is possible and even probable enough. Also, she was a
      Christian, and well educated in her way. But, of course, she remained an
      Oriental, and for a European to marry an Oriental is, as I have tried to
      explain to others, a very dangerous thing, especially if he continues to
      live in the East, where it cuts him off from social recognition and
      intimacy with his own race. Still, although this step of mine forced me to
      leave Cairo and go to Assouan, then a little-known place, to practise
      chiefly among the natives, God knows we were happy enough together till
      the plague took her, and with it my joy in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass over all that business, since there are some things too dreadful
      and too sacred to write about. She left me one child, a son, who, to fill
      up my cup of sorrow, when he was twelve years of age, was kidnapped by the
      Mardi&rsquo;s people.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brings me to the real story. There is nobody else to write it; Oliver
      will not; Higgs cannot (outside of anything learned and antiquarian, he is
      hopeless); so I must. At any rate, if it is not interesting, the fault
      will be mine, not that of the story, which in all conscience is strange
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are now in the middle of June, and it was a year ago last December
      that, on the evening of the day of my arrival in London after an absence
      of half a lifetime, I found myself knocking at the door of Professor
      Higgs&rsquo;s rooms in Guildford Street, W.C. It was opened by his housekeeper,
      Mrs. Reid, a thin and saturnine old woman, who reminded and still reminds
      me of a reanimated mummy. She told me that the Professor was in, but had a
      gentleman to dinner, and suggested sourly that I should call again the
      next morning. With difficulty I persuaded her at last to inform her master
      that an old Egyptian friend had brought him something which he certainly
      would like to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later I groped my way into Higgs&rsquo;s sitting-room, which Mrs.
      Reid had contented herself with indicating from a lower floor. It is a
      large room, running the whole width of the house, divided into two by an
      arch, where once, in the Georgian days, there had been folding doors. The
      place was in shadow, except for the firelight, which shone upon a table
      laid ready for dinner, and upon an extraordinary collection of
      antiquities, including a couple of mummies with gold faces arranged in
      their coffins against the wall. At the far end of the room, however, an
      electric lamp was alight in the bow-window hanging over another table
      covered with books, and by it I saw my host, whom I had not met for twenty
      years, although until I vanished into the desert we frequently
      corresponded, and with him the friend who had come to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, I will describe Higgs, who, I may state, is admitted, even by his
      enemies, to be one of the most learned antiquarians and greatest masters
      of dead languages in Europe, though this no one would guess from his
      appearance at the age of about forty-five. In build short and stout, face
      round and high-coloured, hair and beard of a fiery red, eyes, when they
      can be seen&mdash;for generally he wears a pair of large blue spectacles&mdash;small
      and of an indefinite hue, but sharp as needles. Dress so untidy, peculiar,
      and worn that it is said the police invariably request him to move on,
      should he loiter in the streets at night. Such was, and is, the outward
      seeming of my dearest friend, Professor Ptolemy Higgs, and I only hope
      that he won&rsquo;t be offended when he sees it set down in black and white.
    </p>
    <p>
      That of his companion who was seated at the table, his chin resting on his
      hand, listening to some erudite discourse with a rather distracted air,
      was extraordinarily different, especially by contrast. A tall well-made
      young man, rather thin, but broad-shouldered, and apparently five or six
      and twenty years of age. Face clean-cut&mdash;so much so, indeed, that the
      dark eyes alone relieved it from a suspicion of hardness; hair short and
      straight, like the eyes, brown; expression that of a man of thought and
      ability, and, when he smiled, singularly pleasant. Such was, and is,
      Captain Oliver Orme, who, by the way, I should explain, is only a captain
      of some volunteer engineers, although, in fact, a very able soldier, as
      was proved in the South African War, whence he had then but lately
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ought to add also that he gave me the impression of a man not in love
      with fortune, or rather of one with whom fortune was not in love; indeed,
      his young face seemed distinctly sad. Perhaps it was this that attracted
      me to him so much from the first moment that my eyes fell on him&mdash;me
      with whom fortune had also been out of love for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I stood contemplating this pair, Higgs, looking up from the papyrus
      or whatever it might be that he was reading (I gathered later that he had
      spent the afternoon in unrolling a mummy, and was studying its spoils),
      caught sight of me standing in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the devil are you?&rdquo; he exclaimed in a shrill and strident voice, for
      it acquires that quality when he is angry or alarmed, &ldquo;and what are you
      doing in my room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady,&rdquo; said his companion; &ldquo;your housekeeper told you that some friend
      of yours had come to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, so she did, only I can&rsquo;t remember any friend with a face and
      beard like a goat. Advance, friend, and all&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I stepped into the shining circle of the electric light and halted
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it? Who is it?&rdquo; muttered Higgs. &ldquo;The face is the face of&mdash;of&mdash;I
      have it&mdash;of old Adams, only he&rsquo;s been dead these ten years. The
      Khalifa got him, they said. Antique shade of the long-lost Adams, please
      be so good as to tell me your name, for we waste time over a useless
      mystery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no need, Higgs, since it is in your mouth already. Well, I
      should have known you anywhere; but then <i>your</i> hair doesn&rsquo;t go
      white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not it; too much colouring matter; direct result of a sanguine
      disposition. Well, Adams&mdash;for Adams you must be&mdash;I am really
      delighted to see you, especially as you never answered some questions in
      my last letter as to where you got those First Dynasty scarabs, of which
      the genuineness, I may tell you, has been disputed by certain envious
      beasts. Adams, my dear old fellow, welcome a thousand times&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      seized my hands and wrung them, adding, as his eye fell upon a ring I
      wore, &ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s that? Something quite unusual. But never mind; you
      shall tell me after dinner. Let me introduce you to my friend, Captain
      Orme, a very decent scholar of Arabic, with a quite elementary knowledge
      of Egyptology.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Mr.</i> Orme,&rdquo; interrupted the younger man, bowing to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, Mr. or Captain, whichever you like. He means that he is not in
      the regular army, although he has been all through the Boer War, and
      wounded three times, once straight through the lungs. Here&rsquo;s the soup.
      Mrs. Reid, lay another place. I am dreadfully hungry; nothing gives me
      such an appetite as unrolling mummies; it involves so much intellectual
      wear and tear, in addition to the physical labour. Eat, man, eat. We will
      talk afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we ate, Higgs largely, for his appetite was always excellent, perhaps
      because he was then practically a teetotaller; Mr. Orme very moderately,
      and I as becomes a person who has lived for months at a time on dates&mdash;mainly
      of vegetables, which, with fruits, form my principal diet&mdash;that is,
      if these are available, for at a pinch I can exist on anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the meal was finished and our glasses had been filled with port,
      Higgs helped himself to water, lit the large meerschaum pipe he always
      smokes, and pushed round the tobacco-jar which had once served as a
      sepulchural urn for the heart of an old Egyptian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Adams,&rdquo; he said when we also had filled our pipes, &ldquo;tell us what has
      brought you back from the Shades. In short, your story, man, your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I drew the ring he had noticed off my hand, a thick band of rather
      light-coloured gold of a size such as an ordinary woman might wear upon
      her first or second finger, in which was set a splendid slab of sapphire
      engraved with curious and archaic characters. Pointing to these
      characters, I asked Higgs if he could read them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Read them? Of course,&rdquo; he answered, producing a magnifying glass. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
      you? No, I remember; you never were good at anything more than fifty years
      old. Hullo! this is early Hebrew. Ah! I&rsquo;ve got it,&rdquo; and he read:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The gift of Solomon the ruler&mdash;no, the Great One&mdash;of Israel,
      Beloved of Jah, to Maqueda of Sheba-land, Queen, Daughter of Kings, Child
      of Wisdom, Beautiful.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the writing on your ring, Adams&mdash;a really magnificent thing.
      &lsquo;Queen of Sheba&mdash;Bath-Melachim, Daughter of Kings,&rsquo; with our old
      friend Solomon chucked in. Splendid, quite splendid!&rdquo;&mdash;and he touched
      the gold with his tongue, and tested it with his teeth. &ldquo;Hum&mdash;where
      did you get this intelligent fraud from, Adams?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I answered, laughing, &ldquo;the usual thing, of course. I bought it from
      a donkey-boy in Cairo for about thirty shillings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; he replied suspiciously. &ldquo;I should have thought the stone in it
      was worth more than that, although, of course, it may be nothing but
      glass. The engraving, too, is first-rate. Adams,&rdquo; he added with severity,
      &ldquo;you are trying to hoax us, but let me tell you what I thought you knew by
      this time&mdash;that you can&rsquo;t take in Ptolemy Higgs. This ring is a
      shameless swindle; but who did the Hebrew on it? He&rsquo;s a good scholar,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t aware till now that it was Hebrew. To
      tell you the truth, I thought it was old Egyptian. All I do know is that
      it was given, or rather lent, to me by a lady whose title is Walda
      Nagasta, and who is supposed to be a descendant of Solomon and the Queen
      of Sheba.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Higgs took up the ring and looked at it again; then, as though in a fit of
      abstraction, slipped it into his waistcoat pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be rude, therefore I will not contradict you,&rdquo; he
      answered with a kind of groan, &ldquo;or, indeed, say anything except that if
      any one else had spun me that yarn I should have told him he was a common
      liar. But, of course, as every schoolboy knows, Walda Nagasta&mdash;that
      is, Child of Kings in Ethiopic&mdash;is much the same as Bath-Melachim&mdash;that
      is, Daughter of Kings in Hebrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Captain Orme burst out laughing, and remarked, &ldquo;It is easy to see why
      you are not altogether popular in the antiquarian world, Higgs. Your
      methods of controversy are those of a savage with a stone axe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you only open your mouth to show your ignorance, Oliver, you had
      better keep it shut. The men who carried stone axes had advanced far
      beyond the state of savagery. But I suggest that you had better give
      Doctor Adams a chance of telling his story, after which you can
      criticize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Captain Orme does not wish to be bored with it,&rdquo; I said, whereon
      he answered at once:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the contrary, I should like to hear it very much&mdash;that is, if you
      are willing to confide in me as well as in Higgs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reflected a moment, since, to tell the truth, for sundry reasons, my
      intention had been to trust no one except the Professor, whom I knew to be
      as faithful as he is rough. Yet some instinct prompted me to make an
      exception in favour of this Captain Orme. I liked the man; there was
      something about those brown eyes of his that appealed to me. Also it
      struck me as odd that he should happen to be present on this occasion, for
      I have always held that there is nothing casual or accidental in the
      world; that even the most trivial circumstances are either ordained, or
      the result of the workings of some inexorable law whereof the end is known
      by whatever power may direct our steps, though it be not yet declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I am willing,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;your face and your friendship with
      the Professor are passport enough for me. Only I must ask you to give me
      your word of honour that without my leave you will repeat nothing of what
      I am about to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he answered, whereon Higgs broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, that will do; you don&rsquo;t want us both to kiss the Book, do you? Who
      sold you that ring, and where have you been for the last dozen years, and
      whence do you come now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been a prisoner of the Khalifa&rsquo;s among other things. I had five
      years of that entertainment of which my back would give some evidence if I
      were to strip. I think I am about the only man who never embraced Islam
      whom they allowed to live, and that was because I am a doctor, and,
      therefore, a useful person. The rest of the time I have spent wandering
      about the North African deserts looking for my son, Roderick. You remember
      the boy, or should, for you are his godfather, and I used to send you
      photographs of him as a little chap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course,&rdquo; said the Professor in a new tone; &ldquo;I came across a
      Christmas letter from him the other day. But, my dear Adams, what
      happened? I never heard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He went up the river to shoot crocodiles against my orders, when he was
      about twelve years old&mdash;not very long after his mother&rsquo;s death, and
      some wandering Mahdi tribesmen kidnapped him and sold him as a slave. I
      have been looking for him ever since, for the poor boy was passed on from
      tribe to tribe, among which his skill as a musician enabled me to follow
      him. The Arabs call him the Singer of Egypt, because of his wonderful
      voice, and it seems that he has learned to play upon their native
      instruments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now where is he?&rdquo; asked Higgs, as one who feared the answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is, or was, a favourite slave among a barbarous, half-negroid people
      called the Fung, who dwell in the far interior of North Central Africa.
      After the fall of the Khalifa I followed him there; it took me several
      years. Some Bedouin were making an expedition to trade with these Fung,
      and I disguised myself as one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On a certain night we camped at the foot of a valley outside a great wall
      which encloses the holy place where their idol is. I rode up to this wall
      and, through the open gateway, heard some one with a beautiful tenor voice
      singing in English. What he sang was a hymn that I had taught my son. It
      begins:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Abide with me, fast falls the eventide.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew the voice again. I dismounted and slipped through the gateway, and
      presently came to an open space, where a young man sat singing upon a sort
      of raised bench with lamps on either side of him, and a large audience in
      front. I saw his face and, notwithstanding the turban which he wore and
      his Eastern robe&mdash;yes, and the passage of all those years&mdash;I
      knew it for that of my son. Some spirit of madness entered into me, and I
      called aloud, &lsquo;Roderick, Roderick!&rsquo; and he started up, staring about him
      wildly. The audience started up also, and one of them caught sight of me
      lurking in the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a howl of rage, for I had desecrated their sanctuary, they sprang at
      me. To save my life, coward that I was, I fled back through the gates.
      Yes, after all those years of seeking, still I fled rather than die, and
      though I was wounded with a spear and stones, managed to reach and spring
      upon my horse. Then, as I was headed off from our camp, I galloped away
      anywhere, still to save my miserable life from those savages, so strongly
      is the instinct of self-preservation implanted in us. From a distance I
      looked back and saw by the light of the fired tents that the Fung were
      attacking the Arabs with whom I had travelled, I suppose because they
      thought them parties to the sacrilege. Afterwards I heard that they killed
      them every one, poor men, but I escaped, who unwittingly had brought their
      fate upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On and on I galloped up a steep road. I remember hearing lions roaring
      round me in the darkness. I remember one of them springing upon my horse
      and the poor beast&rsquo;s scream. Then I remember no more till I found myself&mdash;I
      believe it was a week or so later&mdash;lying on the verandah of a nice
      house, and being attended by some good-looking women of an Abyssinian cast
      of countenance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sounds rather like one of the lost tribes of Israel,&rdquo; remarked Higgs
      sarcastically, puffing at his big meerschaum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something of that sort. The details I will give you later. The main
      facts are that these people who picked me up outside their gates are
      called Abati, live in a town called Mur, and allege themselves to be
      descended from a tribe of Abyssinian Jews who were driven out and migrated
      to this place four or five centuries ago. Briefly, they look something
      like Jews, practise a very debased form of the Jewish religion, are
      civilized and clever after a fashion, but in the last stage of decadence
      from interbreeding&mdash;about nine thousand men is their total fighting
      force, although three or four generations ago they had twenty thousand&mdash;and
      live in hourly terror of extermination by the surrounding Fung, who hold
      them in hereditary hate as the possessors of the wonderful mountain
      fortress that once belonged to their forefathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gibraltar and Spain over again,&rdquo; suggested Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, with this difference&mdash;that the position is reversed, the Abati
      of this Central African Gibraltar are decaying, and the Fung, who answer
      to the Spaniards, are vigorous and increasing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what happened?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing particular. I tried to persuade these Abati to organize an
      expedition to rescue my son, but they laughed in my face. By degrees I
      found out that there was only one person among them who was worth anything
      at all, and she happened to be their hereditary ruler who bore the
      high-sounding titles of Walda Nagasta, or Child of Kings, and Takla Warda,
      or Bud of the Rose, a very handsome and spirited young woman, whose
      personal name is Maqueda&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the names of the first known Queens of Sheba,&rdquo; muttered Higgs;
      &ldquo;the other was Belchis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Under pretence of attending her medically,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;for otherwise
      their wretched etiquette would scarcely have allowed me access to one so
      exalted, I talked things over with her. She told me that the idol of the
      Fung is fashioned like a huge sphinx, or so I gathered from her
      description of the thing, for I have never seen it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Higgs, jumping up, &ldquo;a sphinx in North Central Africa!
      Well, after all, why not? Some of the earlier Pharaohs are said to have
      had dealings with that part of the world, or even to have migrated from
      it. I think that the Makreezi repeats the legend. I suppose that it is
      ram-headed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me also,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;that they have a tradition, or rather a
      belief, which amounts to an article of faith, that if this sphinx or god,
      which, by the way, is lion, not ram-headed, and is called Harmac&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harmac!&rdquo; interrupted Higgs again. &ldquo;That is one of the names of the sphinx&mdash;Harmachis,
      god of dawn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this god,&rdquo; I repeated, &ldquo;should be destroyed, the nation of the Fung,
      whose forefathers fashioned it as they say, must move away from that
      country across the great river which lies to the south. I have forgotten
      its name at the moment, but I think it must be a branch of the Nile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suggested to her that, in the circumstances, her people had better try
      to destroy the idol. Maqueda laughed and said it was impossible, since the
      thing was the size of a small mountain, adding that the Abati had long ago
      lost all courage and enterprise, and were content to sit in their fertile
      and mountain-ringed land, feeding themselves with tales of departed
      grandeur and struggling for rank and high-sounding titles, till the day of
      doom overtook them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I inquired whether she were also content, and she replied, &lsquo;Certainly
      not&rsquo;; but what could she do to regenerate her people, she who was nothing
      but a woman, and the last of an endless line of rulers?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Rid me of the Fung,&rsquo; she added passionately, &lsquo;and I will give you such a
      reward as you never dreamed. The old cave-city yonder is full of treasure
      that was buried with its ancient kings long before we came to Mur. To us
      it is useless, since we have none to trade with, but I have heard that the
      peoples of the outside world worship gold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I do not want gold,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;I want to rescue my son who is a
      prisoner yonder.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Child of Kings, &lsquo;you must begin by helping us to destroy
      the idol of the Fung. Are there no means by which this can be done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;There are means,&rsquo; I replied, and I tried to explain to her the
      properties of dynamite and of other more powerful explosives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Go to your own land,&rsquo; she exclaimed eagerly, &lsquo;and return with that stuff
      and two or three who can manage it, and I swear to them all the wealth of
      Mur. Thus only can you win my help to save your son.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what was the end?&rdquo; asked Captain Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This: They gave me some gold and an escort with camels which were
      literally lowered down a secret path in the mountains so as to avoid the
      Fung, who ring them in and of whom they are terribly afraid. With these
      people I crossed the desert to Assouan in safety, a journey of many weeks,
      where I left them encamped about sixteen days ago, bidding them await my
      return. I arrived in England this morning, and as soon as I could
      ascertain that you still lived, and your address, from a book of reference
      called <i>Who&rsquo;s Who</i>, which they gave me in the hotel, I came on here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you come to me? What do you want me to do?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you, Higgs, because I know how deeply you are interested in
      anything antiquarian, and because I wished to give you the first
      opportunity, not only of winning wealth, but also of becoming famous as
      the discoverer of the most wonderful relics of antiquity that are left in
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a very good chance of getting my throat cut thrown in,&rdquo; grumbled
      Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to what I want you to do,&rdquo; I went on, &ldquo;I want you to find someone who
      understands explosives, and will undertake the business of blowing up the
      Fung idol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s easy enough, anyhow,&rdquo; said the Professor, pointing to
      Captain Orme with the bowl of his pipe, and adding, &ldquo;he is an engineer by
      education, a soldier and a very fair chemist; also he knows Arabic and was
      brought up in Egypt as a boy&mdash;just the man for the job if he will
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I reflected a moment, then, obeying some sort of instinct, looked up and
      asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you, Captain Orme, if terms can be arranged?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yesterday,&rdquo; he replied, colouring a little, &ldquo;I should have answered,
      &lsquo;Certainly not.&rsquo; To-day I answer that I am prepared to consider the matter&mdash;that
      is, if Higgs will go too, and you can enlighten me on certain points. But
      I warn you that I am only an amateur in the three trades that the
      Professor has mentioned, though, it is true, one with some experience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be rude to inquire, Captain Orme, why twenty-four hours have
      made such a difference in your views and plans?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not rude, only awkward,&rdquo; he replied, colouring again, this time more
      deeply. &ldquo;Still, as it is best to be frank, I will tell you. Yesterday I
      believed myself to be the inheritor of a very large fortune from an uncle
      whose fatal illness brought me back from South Africa before I meant to
      come, and as whose heir I have been brought up. To-day I have learned for
      the first time that he married secretly, last year, a woman much below him
      in rank, and has left a child, who, of course, will take all his property,
      as he died intestate. But that is not all. Yesterday I believed myself to
      be engaged to be married; to-day I am undeceived upon that point also. The
      lady,&rdquo; he added with some bitterness, &ldquo;who was willing to marry Anthony
      Orme&rsquo;s heir is no longer willing to marry Oliver Orme, whose total
      possessions amount to under £10,000. Well, small blame to her or to her
      relations, whichever it may be, especially as I understand that she has a
      better alliance in view. Certainly her decision has simplified matters,&rdquo;
       and he rose and walked to the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shocking business,&rdquo; whispered Higgs; &ldquo;been infamously treated,&rdquo; and he
      proceeded to express his opinion of the lady concerned, of her relatives,
      and of the late Anthony Orme, shipowner, in language that, if printed,
      would render this history unfit for family reading. The outspokenness of
      Professor Higgs is well known in the antiquarian world, so there is no
      need for me to enlarge upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I do not exactly understand, Adams,&rdquo; he added in a loud voice,
      seeing that Orme had turned again, &ldquo;and what I think we should both like
      to know, is <i>your</i> exact object in making these proposals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid I have explained myself badly. I thought I had made it clear
      that I have only one object&mdash;to attempt the rescue of my son, if he
      still lives, as I believe he does. Higgs, put yourself in my position.
      Imagine yourself with nothing and no one left to care for except a single
      child, and that child stolen away from you by savages. Imagine yourself,
      after years of search, hearing his very voice, seeing his very face, adult
      now, but the same, the thing you had dreamed of and desired for years;
      that for which you would have given a thousand lives if you could have had
      time to think. And then the rush of the howling, fantastic mob, the
      breakdown of courage, of love, of everything that is noble under the
      pressure of primæval instinct, which has but one song&mdash;Save your
      life. Lastly, imagine this coward saved, dwelling within a few miles of
      the son whom he had deserted, and yet utterly unable to rescue or even to
      communicate with him because of the poltroonery of those among whom he had
      refuged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; grunted Higgs, &ldquo;I have imagined all that high-faluting lot. What
      of it? If you mean that you are to blame, I don&rsquo;t agree with you. You
      wouldn&rsquo;t have helped your son by getting your own throat cut, and perhaps
      his also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I have brooded over the thing so long that it
      seems to me that I have disgraced myself. Well, there came a chance, and I
      took it. This lady, Walda Nagasta, or Maqueda, who, I think, had also
      brooded over things, made me an offer&mdash;I fancy without the knowledge
      or consent of her Council. &lsquo;Help me,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and I will help you. Save
      my people, and I will try to save your son. I can pay for your services
      and those of any whom you may bring with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered that it was hopeless, as no one would believe the tale,
      whereon she drew from her finger the throne-ring or State signet which you
      have in your pocket, Higgs, saying: &lsquo;My mothers have worn this since the
      days of Maqueda, Queen of Sheba. If there are learned men among your
      people they will read her name upon it and know that I speak no lie. Take
      it as a token, and take also enough of our gold to buy the stuffs whereof
      you speak, which hide fires that can throw mountains skyward, and the
      services of skilled and trusty men who are masters of the stuff, two or
      three of them only, for more cannot be transported across the desert, and
      come back to save your son and me.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s all the story, Higgs. Will you
      take the business on, or shall I try elsewhere? You must make up your
      mind, because I have no time to lose, if I am to get into Mur again before
      the rains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any of that gold you spoke of about you?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      I drew a skin bag from the pocket of my coat, and poured some out upon the
      table, which he examined carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ring money,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;might be Anglo-Saxon, might be anything;
      date absolutely uncertain, but from its appearance I should say slightly
      alloyed with silver; yes, there is a bit which has oxydized&mdash;undoubtedly
      old, that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he produced the signet from his pocket, and examined the ring and the
      stone very carefully through a powerful glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seems all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and although I have been greened in my time,
      I don&rsquo;t make many mistakes nowadays. What do you say, Adams? Must have it
      back? A sacred trust! Only lent to you! All right, take it by all means.
      <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want the thing. Well, it is a risky job, and if any one
      else had proposed it to me, I&rsquo;d have told him to go to&mdash;Mur. But,
      Adams, my boy, you saved my life once, and never sent in a bill, because I
      was hard up, and I haven&rsquo;t forgotten that. Also things are pretty hot for
      me here just now over a certain controversy of which I suppose you haven&rsquo;t
      heard in Central Africa. I think I&rsquo;ll go. What do you say, Oliver?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Captain Orme, waking up from a reverie, &ldquo;if you are satisfied,
      I am. It doesn&rsquo;t matter to me where I go.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ADVICE OF SERGEANT QUICK
    </h3>
    <p>
      At this moment a fearful hubbub arose without. The front door slammed, a
      cab drove off furiously, a policeman&rsquo;s whistle blew, heavy feet were heard
      trampling; then came an invocation of &ldquo;In the King&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; answered by
      &ldquo;Yes, and the Queen&rsquo;s, and the rest of the Royal Family&rsquo;s, and if you want
      it, take it, you chuckle-headed, flat-footed, pot-bellied Peelers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed tumult indescribable as of heavy men and things rolling down
      the stairs, with cries of fear and indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the dickens is that?&rdquo; asked Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The voice sounded like that of Samuel&mdash;I mean Sergeant Quick,&rdquo;
       answered Captain Orme with evident alarm; &ldquo;what can he be after? Oh, I
      know, it is something to do with that infernal mummy you unwrapped this
      afternoon, and asked him to bring round after dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the door burst open, and a tall, soldier-like form stalked in,
      carrying in his arms a corpse wrapped in a sheet, which he laid upon the
      table among the wine glasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Captain,&rdquo; he said, addressing Orme, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve lost the head of
      the departed. I think it is at the bottom of the stairs with the police.
      Had nothing else to defend myself with, sir, against their unwarranted
      attacks, so brought the body to the present and charged, thinking it very
      stiff and strong, but regret to say neck snapped, and that deceased&rsquo;s head
      is now under arrest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Sergeant Quick finished speaking, the door opened again, and through it
      appeared two very flurried and dishevelled policemen, one of whom held, as
      far as possible from his person, the grizzly head of a mummy by the long
      hair which still adhered to the skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by breaking into my rooms like this? Where&rsquo;s your
      warrant?&rdquo; asked the indignant Higgs in his high voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; answered the first policeman, pointing to the sheet-wrapped form
      on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And here!&rdquo; added the second, holding up the awful head. &ldquo;As in duty
      bound, we ask explanation from that man of the secret conveyance of a
      corpse through the open streets, whereon he assaults us with the same, for
      which assault, pending investigation of the corpse, I arrest him. Now,
      Guv&rsquo;nor&rdquo; (addressing Sergeant Quick), &ldquo;will you come along with us
      quietly, or must we take you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sergeant, who seemed to be inarticulate with wrath, made a dash for
      the shrouded object on the table, with the intention, apparently, of once
      more using it as a weapon of offence, and the policemen drew their batons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said Orme, thrusting himself between the combatants, &ldquo;are you all
      mad? Do you know that this woman died about four thousand years ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said the policeman who held the head, addressing his
      companion, &ldquo;it must be one of them mummies what they dig up in the British
      Museum. Seems pretty ancient and spicy, don&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; and he sniffed at the
      head, then set it down upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanations followed, and after the wounded dignity of the two officers
      of the Force had been soothed with sundry glasses of port wine and a
      written list of the names of all concerned, including that of the mummy,
      they departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You take my advice, bobbies,&rdquo; I heard the indignant Sergeant declaim
      outside the door, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you believe things is always what they seem.
      A party ain&rsquo;t necessarily drunk because he rolls about and falls down in
      the street; he may be mad, or &lsquo;ungry, or epileptic, and a body ain&rsquo;t
      always a body jest because it&rsquo;s dead and cold and stiff. Why, men, as
      you&rsquo;ve seen, it may be a mummy, which is quite a different thing. If I was
      to put on that blue coat of yours, would that make me a policeman? Good
      heavens! I should hope not, for the sake of the Army to which I still
      belong, being in the Reserve. What you bobbies need is to study human
      nature and cultivate observation, which will learn you the difference
      between a new-laid corpse and a mummy, and many other things. Now you lay
      my words to heart, and you&rsquo;ll both of you rise to superintendents, instead
      of running in daily &lsquo;drunks&rsquo; until you retire on a pension. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peace having been restored, and the headless mummy removed into the
      Professor&rsquo;s bedroom, since Captain Orme declared that he could not talk
      business in the presence of a body, however ancient, we resumed our
      discussion. First of all, at Higgs&rsquo;s suggestion I drew up a brief
      memorandum of agreement which set out the objects of the expedition, and
      provided for the equal division amongst us of any profit that might
      accrue; in the event of the death of one or more of us, the survivors or
      survivor to take their or his share.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this arrangement personally I objected, who desired neither treasure
      nor antiquities, but only the rescue of my son. The others pointed out,
      however, that, like most people, I might in future want something to live
      on, or that if I did not, in the event of his escape, my boy certainly
      would; so in the end I gave way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Captain Orme very sensibly asked for a definition of our respective
      duties, and it was settled that I was to be guide to the expedition;
      Higgs, antiquarian, interpreter, and, on account of his vast knowledge,
      general referee; and Captain Orme, engineer and military commander, with
      the proviso that, in the event of a difference of opinion, the dissentient
      was to loyally accept the decision of the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      This curious document having been copied out fair, I signed and passed it
      to the Professor, who hesitated a little, but, after refreshing himself
      with a further minute examination of Sheba&rsquo;s ring, signed also, remarking
      that he was an infernal fool for his pains, and pushed the paper across
      the table to Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop a minute,&rdquo; said the Captain; &ldquo;I forgot something. I should like my
      old servant, Sergeant Quick, to accompany us. He&rsquo;s a very handy man at a
      pinch, especially if, as I understand, we are expected to deal with
      explosives with which he has had a lot to do in the Engineers and
      elsewhere. If you agree I will call him, and ask if he will go. I expect
      he&rsquo;s somewhere round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, judging from the episode of the mummy and the policeman that the
      Sergeant was likely to be a useful man. As I was sitting next to it, I
      opened the door for the Captain, whereon the erect shape of Sergeant
      Quick, who had clearly been leaning against it, literally fell into the
      room, reminding me much of an overset wooden soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Orme as, without the slightest change of countenance, his
      retainer recovered himself and stood to attention. &ldquo;What the deuce are you
      doing there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sentry go, Captain. Thought the police might change their minds and come
      back. Any orders, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I am going to North Central Africa. When can you be ready to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Brindisi mail leaves to-morrow night, Captain, if you travel by
      Egypt, but if you go by Tunis, 7.15 a.m. Saturday is the time from Charing
      Cross. Only, as I understand that high explosives and arms have to be
      provided, these might take awhile to lay in and pack so as to deceive
      customs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand!&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;Pray, how do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doors in these old houses are apt to get away from their frames, Captain,
      and the gentleman there&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the Professor&mdash;&ldquo;has
      a voice that carries like a dog-whistle. Oh, no offence, sir. A clear
      voice is an excellent thing&mdash;that is, if the doors fit&rdquo;&mdash;and
      although Sergeant Quick&rsquo;s wooden face did not move, I saw his humorous
      grey eyes twinkle beneath the bushy eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      We burst out laughing, including Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are willing to go?&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;But I hope you clearly understand
      that this is a risky business, and that you may not come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spion Kop was a bit risky, Captain, and so was that business in the
      donga, where every one was hit except you and me and the sailor man, but
      we came back, for all that. Begging your pardon, Captain, there ain&rsquo;t no
      such thing as risk. Man comes here when he must, and dies when he must,
      and what he does between don&rsquo;t make a ha&rsquo;porth of difference.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hear, hear,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;we are much of the same way of thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There have been several who held those views, sir, since old Solomon gave
      the lady that&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to Sheba&rsquo;s ring, which was lying on
      the table. &ldquo;But excuse me, Captain; how about local allowances? Not having
      been a marrying man myself, I&rsquo;ve none dependent upon me, but, as you know,
      I&rsquo;ve sisters that have, and a soldier&rsquo;s pension goes with him. Don&rsquo;t think
      me greedy, Captain,&rdquo; he added hastily, &ldquo;but, as you gentlemen understand,
      black and white at the beginning saves bother at the end&rdquo;&mdash;and he
      pointed to the agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right. What do you want, Sergeant?&rdquo; asked Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing beyond my pay, if we get nothing, Captain, but if we get
      something, would five per cent. be too much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might be ten,&rdquo; I suggested. &ldquo;Sergeant Quick has a life to lose like
      the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you kindly, sir,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but that, in my opinion, would be
      too much. Five per cent. was what I suggested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it was written down that Sergeant Samuel Quick was to receive five per
      cent. of the total profits, if any, provided that he behaved himself and
      obeyed orders. Then he also signed the agreement, and was furnished with a
      glass of whisky and water to drink to its good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, declining the chair which Higgs offered to him,
      apparently because, from long custom, he preferred his wooden-soldier
      attitude against the wall, &ldquo;as a humble five-per-cent. private in this
      very adventurous company I&rsquo;ll ask permission to say a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Permission was given accordingly, and the Sergeant proceeded to inquire
      what weight of rock it was wished to remove.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him that I did not know, as I had never seen the Fung idol, but I
      understood that its size was enormous, probably as large as St. Paul&rsquo;s
      Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which, if solid, would take some stirring,&rdquo; remarked the Sergeant.
      &ldquo;Dynamite might do it, but it is too bulky to be carried across the desert
      on camels in that quantity. Captain, how about them picrates? You remember
      those new Boer shells that blew a lot of us to kingdom come, and poisoned
      the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Orme; &ldquo;I remember; but now they have stronger stuffs&mdash;azo-imides,
      I think they call them&mdash;terrific new compounds of nitrogen. We will
      inquire to-morrow, Sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but the point is, who&rsquo;ll pay? You can&rsquo;t buy
      hell-fire in bulk for nothing. I calculate that, allowing for the purchase
      of the explosives and, say, fifty military rifles with ammunition and all
      other necessaries, not including camels, the outfit of this expedition
      can&rsquo;t come to less than £1,500.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I have that amount in gold,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;of which the lady of
      the Abati gave me as much as I could carry in comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If not,&rdquo; said Orme, &ldquo;although I am a poor man now, I could find £500 or
      so in a pinch. So don&rsquo;t let us bother about the money. The question is&mdash;Are
      we all agreed that we will undertake this expedition and see it through to
      the end, whatever that may be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We answered that we were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then has anybody anything more to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I forgot to tell you that if we should ever get to Mur,
      none of you must make love to the Walda Nagasta. She is a kind of holy
      person, who can only marry into her own family, and to do so might mean
      that our throats would be cut.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear that, Oliver?&rdquo; said the Professor. &ldquo;I suppose that the
      Doctor&rsquo;s warning is meant for you, as the rest of us are rather past that
      kind of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied the Captain, colouring again after his fashion. &ldquo;Well,
      to tell you the truth, I feel a bit past it myself, and, so far as I am
      concerned, I don&rsquo;t think we need take the fascinations of this black lady
      into account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t brag, Captain. Please don&rsquo;t brag,&rdquo; said Sergeant Quick in a hollow
      whisper. &ldquo;Woman is just the one thing about which you can never be sure.
      To-day she&rsquo;s poison, and to-morrow honey&mdash;God and the climate alone
      know why. Please don&rsquo;t brag, or we may live to see you crawling after this
      one on your knees, with the gent in the specs behind, and Samuel Quick,
      who hates the whole tribe of them, bringing up the rear. Tempt Providence,
      if you like, Captain, but don&rsquo;t tempt woman, lest she should turn round
      and tempt you, as she has done before to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be so good as to stop talking nonsense and call a cab,&rdquo; said
      Captain Orme coldly. But Higgs began to laugh in his rude fashion, and I,
      remembering the appearance of &ldquo;Bud of the Rose&rdquo; when she lifted her veil
      of ceremony, and the soft earnestness of her voice, fell into reflection.
      &ldquo;Black lady&rdquo; indeed! What, I wondered, would this young gentleman think if
      ever he should live to set his eyes upon her sweet and comely face?
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to me that Sergeant Quick was not so foolish as his master chose
      to imagine. Captain Orme undoubtedly was in every way qualified to be a
      partner in our venture; still, I could have wished either that he had been
      an older man, or that the lady to whom he was recently affianced had not
      chosen this occasion to break her engagement. In dealing with difficult
      and dangerous combinations, my experience has been that it is always well
      to eliminate the possibility of a love affair, especially in the East.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE PROFESSOR GOES OUT SHOOTING
    </h3>
    <p>
      Of all our tremendous journey across the desert until we had passed the
      forest and reached the plains which surrounded the mountains of Mur, there
      are, I think, but few incidents with which the reader need be troubled.
      The first of these was at Assouan, where a letter and various telegrams
      overtook Captain Orme, which, as by this time we had become intimate, he
      showed to me. They informed him that the clandestine infant whom his uncle
      left behind him had suddenly sickened and died of some childish ailment,
      so that he was once again heir to the large property which he thought he
      had lost, since the widow only took a life interest in some of the
      personalty. I congratulated him and said I supposed this meant that we
      should not have the pleasure of his company to Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I said I was going and I mean to go; indeed, I
      signed a document to that effect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but circumstances alter cases. If I might say
      so, an adventure that perhaps was good enough for a young and well-born
      man of spirit and enterprise without any particular resources, is no
      longer good enough for one who has the ball at his feet. Think what a ball
      it is to a man of your birth, intelligence, record, and now, great fortune
      come to you in youth. Why, with these advantages there is absolutely
      nothing that you cannot do in England. You can go into Parliament and rule
      the country; if you like you can become a peer. You can marry any one who
      isn&rsquo;t of the blood royal; in short, with uncommonly little effort of your
      own, your career is made for you. Don&rsquo;t throw away a silver spoon like
      that in order, perhaps, to die of thirst in the desert or be killed in a
      fight among unknown tribes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I never set heart much on spoons, silver
      or other. When I lost this one I didn&rsquo;t cry, and now that I have found it
      again I shan&rsquo;t sing. Anyway, I am going on with you, and you can&rsquo;t prevent
      me under the agreement. Only as I have got such a lot to leave, I suppose
      I had better make a will first and post it home, which is a bore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then the Professor came in, followed by an Arab thief of a dealer,
      with whom he was trying to bargain for some object of antiquity. When the
      dealer had been ejected and the position explained to him, Higgs, who
      whatever may be his failings in small matters, is unselfish enough in big
      ones, said that he agreed with me and thought that under the
      circumstances, in his own interest, Orme ought to leave us and return
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may save your breath, old fellow,&rdquo; answered the Captain, &ldquo;for this
      reason if for no other,&rdquo; and he threw him a letter across the table, which
      letter I saw afterwards. To be brief, it was from the young lady to whom
      he had been engaged to be married, and who on his loss of fortune had
      jilted him. Now she seemed to have changed her mind again, and, although
      she did not mention the matter, it is perhaps not uncharitable to suppose
      that the news of the death of the inconvenient child had something to do
      with her decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you answered this?&rdquo; asked Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Orme, setting his mouth. &ldquo;I have not answered, and I am not
      going to answer it, either in writing or in person. I intend to start
      to-morrow for Mur and to travel as far on that road as it pleases fate to
      allow, and now I am going to look at the rock sculptures by the cataract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s flat,&rdquo; said Higgs after he had departed, &ldquo;and for my part I
      am glad of it, for somehow I think he will be a useful man among those
      Fung. Also, if he went I expect that the Sergeant would go too, and where
      should we be without Quick, I should like to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards I conversed with the said Quick about this same matter,
      repeating to him my opinions, to which the Sergeant listened with the
      deference which he was always kind enough to show to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, sir,&rdquo; he said, when I had finished, &ldquo;but I think you
      are both right and wrong. Everything has two ends, hasn&rsquo;t it? You say that
      it would be wicked for the Captain to get himself killed, there being now
      so much money for him to live for, seeing that life is common as dirt
      while money is precious, rare and hard to come by. It ain&rsquo;t the kings we
      admire, it&rsquo;s their crowns; it ain&rsquo;t the millionaires, it&rsquo;s their millions;
      but, after all, the millionaires don&rsquo;t take their millions with them, for
      Providence, that, like Nature, hates waste, knows that if they did they&rsquo;d
      melt, so one man dead gives another bread, as the saying goes, or p&rsquo;raps I
      should say gingerbread in such cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, on the whole, sir, I admit you are right as to the sinfulness of
      wasting luck. But now comes the other end. I know this young lady what the
      Captain was engaged to, which he never would have been if he had taken my
      advice, since of all the fish-blooded little serpents that ever I set eyes
      on she&rsquo;s the serpentest, though pretty, I allow. Solomon said in his haste
      that an honest woman he had not found, but if he had met the Honourable
      Miss&mdash;well, never mind her name&mdash;he&rsquo;d have said it at his
      leisure, and gone on saying it. Now, no one should never take back a
      servant what has given notice and then says he&rsquo;s sorry, for if he does the
      sorrow will be on the other side before it&rsquo;s all done; and much less
      should he take back a <i>fiancée</i> (Quick said a &lsquo;finance&rsquo;), on the
      whole, he&rsquo;d better drown himself&mdash;I tried it once, and I know. So
      that&rsquo;s the tail of the business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it has a couple of fins as well, like that eel beast I
      caught in the Nile. One of them is that the Captain promised and vowed to
      go through with this expedition, and if a man&rsquo;s got to die, he&rsquo;d better
      die honest without breaking his word. And the other is what I said to you
      in London when I signed on, that he won&rsquo;t die a minute before his time,
      and nothing won&rsquo;t happen to him, but what&rsquo;s bound to happen, and therefore
      it ain&rsquo;t a ha&rsquo;porth of use bothering about anything, and that&rsquo;s where the
      East&rsquo;s well ahead of the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, sir, I&rsquo;ll go and look after the camels and those half-bred Jew
      boys what you call Abati, but I call rotten sneaks, for if they get their
      thieving fingers into those canisters of picric salts, thinking they&rsquo;re
      jam, as I found them trying to do yesterday, something may happen in Egypt
      that&rsquo;ll make the Pharaohs turn in their graves and the Ten Plagues look
      silly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, having finished his oration, Quick went, and in due course we started
      for Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second incident that is perhaps worth recording was an adventure that
      happened to us when we had completed about two of our four months&rsquo; 
      journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      After weeks of weary desert travel&mdash;if I remember right, it was
      exactly a fortnight after the dog Pharaoh, of which I shall soon have
      plenty to say, had come into Orme&rsquo;s possession&mdash;we reached an oasis
      called Zeu, where I had halted upon my road down to Egypt. In this oasis,
      which, although not large in extent, possesses springs of beautiful water
      and groves of date-trees, we were, as it chanced, very welcome, since when
      I was there before, I had been fortunate enough to cure its sheik of an
      attack of ophthalmia and to doctor several of his people for various
      ailments with good results. So, although I was burning to get forward, I
      agreed with the others that it would be wise to accede to the request of
      the leader of our caravan, a clever and resourceful, but to my mind
      untrustworthy Abati of the name of Shadrach, and camp in Zeu for a week or
      so to rest and feed our camels, which had wasted almost to nothing on the
      scant herbage of the desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Shadrach, I may add here, whom his companions, for some reason
      unknown to me at that time, called the Cat, was remarkable for a triple
      line of scars upon his face, which, he informed me, had been set there by
      the claws of a lion. Now the great enemies of this people of Zeu were
      lions, which at certain seasons of the year, I suppose when food grew
      scarce, descended from the slopes of a range of hills that stretched east
      and west at a distance of about fifty miles north of the oasis, and,
      crossing the intervening desert, killed many of the Zeu sheep, camels, and
      other cattle, and often enough any of the tribe whom they could catch. As
      these poor Zeus practically possessed no firearms, they were at the mercy
      of the lions, which grew correspondingly bold. Indeed, their only resource
      was to kraal their animals within stone walls at night and take refuge in
      their huts, which they seldom left between sunset and dawn, except to
      replenish the fires that they lit to scare any beast of prey which might
      be prowling through the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the lion season was now in full swing, as it happened, for the
      first five days of our stay at Zeu we saw none of these great cats,
      although in the darkness we heard them roaring in the distance. On the
      sixth night, however, we were awakened by a sound of wailing, which came
      from the village about a quarter of a mile away, and when we went out at
      dawn to see what was the matter, were met by a melancholy procession
      advancing from its walls. At the head of it marched the grey-haired old
      chief, followed by a number of screaming women, who in their excitement,
      or perhaps as a sign of mourning, had omitted to make their toilette, and
      by four men, who carried something horrid on a wickerwork door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon we learned what had happened. It seemed that hungry lions, two or
      three of them, had broken through the palm-leaf roof of the hut of one of
      the sheik&rsquo;s wives, she whose remains were stretched upon the door, and, in
      addition to killing her, had actually carried off his son. Now he came to
      implore us white men who had guns to revenge him on the lions, which
      otherwise, having once tasted human flesh, would destroy many more of his
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through an interpreter who knew Arabic, for not even Higgs could
      understand the peculiar Zeu dialect, he explained in excited and
      incoherent words that the beasts lay up among the sand-hills not very far
      away, where some thick reeds grew around a little spring of water. Would
      we not come out and kill them and earn the blessing of the Zeus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I said nothing, for the simple reason that, having such big matters on
      hand, although I was always fond of sport, I did not wish any of us to be
      led off after these lions. There is a time to hunt and a time to cease
      from hunting, and it seemed to me, except for the purposes of food, that
      this journey of ours was the latter. However, as I expected, Oliver Orme
      literally leaped at the idea. So did Higgs, who of late had been
      practising with a rifle and began to fancy himself a shot. He exclaimed
      loudly that nothing would give him greater pleasure, especially as he was
      sure that lions were in fact cowardly and overrated beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment I foreboded disaster in my heart. Still, I said I would
      come too, partly because I had not shot a lion for many a day and had a
      score to settle with those beasts which, it may be remembered, nearly
      killed me on the Mountain of Mur, and partly because, knowing the desert
      and also the Zeu people much better than either the Professor or Orme, I
      thought that I might possibly be of service.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we fetched our rifles and cartridges, to which by an afterthought we
      added two large water-bottles, and ate a hearty breakfast. As we were
      preparing to start, Shadrach, the leader of the Abati camel-drivers, that
      man with the scarred face who was nicknamed the Cat, came up to me and
      asked me whither we were going. I told him, whereon he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to do with these savages and their troubles, lords? If a
      few of them are killed it is no matter, but as you should know, O Doctor,
      if you wish to hunt lions there are plenty in that land whither you
      travel, seeing that the lion is the fetish of the Fung and therefore never
      killed. But the desert about Zeu is dangerous and harm may come to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then accompany us,&rdquo; broke in the Professor, between whom and Shadrach
      there was no love lost, &ldquo;for, of course, with you we should be quite
      safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I and my people rest; only madmen would go to hunt
      worthless wild beasts when they might rest. Have we not enough of the
      desert and its dangers as it is? If you knew all that I do of lions you
      would leave them alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of the desert we have plenty also, but of shooting very little,&rdquo; remarked
      the Captain, who talked Arabic well. &ldquo;Lie in your beds; we go to kill the
      beasts that harass the poor people who have treated us so kindly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Shadrach with a smile that struck me as malicious. &ldquo;A
      lion made this&rdquo;&mdash;pointing to the dreadful threefold scar upon his
      face. &ldquo;May the God of Israel protect you from lions. Remember, lords,
      that, the camels being fresh again, we march the day after to-morrow,
      should the weather hold, for if the wind blows on yonder sand-hills, no
      man may live among them;&rdquo; and, putting up his hand, he studied the sky
      carefully from beneath its shadow, then, with a grunt, turned and vanished
      behind a hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this while Sergeant Quick was engaged at a little distance in washing
      up the tin breakfast things, to all appearance quite unconscious of what
      was going on. Orme called him, whereupon he advanced and stood to
      attention. I remember thinking how curious he looked in those surroundings&mdash;his
      tall, bony frame clothed in semi-military garments, his wooden face
      perfectly shaved, his iron-grey hair neatly parted and plastered down upon
      his head with pomade or some equivalent after the old private soldier
      fashion, and his sharp ferret-like grey eyes taking in everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you coming with us, Sergeant?&rdquo; asked Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not unless ordered so to do, Captain. I like a bit of hunting well
      enough, but, with all three officers away, some one should mount guard
      over the stores and transport, so I think the dog Pharaoh and I had best
      stop behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you are right, Sergeant, only tie Pharaoh up, or he&rsquo;ll follow me.
      Well, what do you want to say? Out with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only this, Captain. Although I have served in three campaigns among these
      here Arabians (to Quick, all African natives north of the Equator were
      Arabians, and all south of it, niggers), I can&rsquo;t say I talk their lingo
      well. Still, I made out that the fellow they call Cat don&rsquo;t like this trip
      of yours, and, begging your pardon, Captain, whatever else Cat may be, he
      ain&rsquo;t no fool.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help it, Sergeant. For one thing, it would never do to give in to
      his fancies now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, Captain. When once it&rsquo;s hoist, right or wrong, keep the flag
      flying, and no doubt you&rsquo;ll come back safe and sound if you&rsquo;re meant to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, having relieved his mind, the Sergeant ran his eye over our
      equipment to see that nothing had been forgotten, rapidly assured himself
      that the rifles were in working order, reported all well, and returned to
      his dishes. Little did any of us guess under what circumstances we should
      next meet with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After leaving the town and marching for a mile or so along the oasis,
      accompanied by a mob of the Zeus armed with spears and bows, we were led
      by the bereaved chief, who also acted as tracker, out into the surrounding
      sands. The desert here, although I remembered it well enough, was
      different from any that we had yet encountered upon this journey, being
      composed of huge and abrupt sand-hills, some of which were quite three
      hundred feet high, separated from each other by deep, wind-cut valleys.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a distance, while they were within reach of the moist air of the
      oasis, these sand-mountains produced vegetation of various sorts.
      Presently, however, we passed out into the wilderness proper, and for a
      while climbed up and down the steep, shifting slopes, till from the crest
      of one of them the chief pointed out what in South Africa is called a pan,
      or <i>vlei</i>, covered with green reeds, and explained by signs that in
      these lay the lions. Descending a steep declivity, we posted ourselves, I
      at the top, and Higgs and Orme a little way down either side of this <i>vlei</i>.
      This done, we dispatched the Zeus to beat it out towards us, for although
      the reeds grew thick along the course of the underground water, it was but
      a narrow place, and not more than a quarter of a mile in length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had the beaters entered the tall reeds, evidently with
      trepidation, for a good many of them held back from the adventure, when a
      sound of loud wailing informed us that something had happened. A minute or
      two later we saw two of them bearing away what appeared to be the mangled
      remains of the chief&rsquo;s son who had been carried off on the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, too, we saw something else, for half-way down the marsh a great
      male lion broke cover, and began to steal off toward the sand-hills. It
      was about two hundred yards from Higgs, who chanced to be nearest to it,
      and, therefore, as any big-game hunter will know, for practical purposes,
      far out of shot. But the Professor, who was quite unaccustomed to this,
      or, indeed, any kind of sport, and, like all beginners, wildly anxious for
      blood, lifted his rifle and fired, as he might have done at a rabbit. By
      some marvellous accident the aim was good, and the bullet from the
      express, striking the lion fair behind the shoulder, passed through its
      heart, and knocked it over dead as a stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jingo! Did you see that?&rdquo; screamed Higgs in his delight. Then, without
      even stopping to reload the empty barrel, he set off at the top of his
      speed toward the prostrate beast, followed by myself and by Orme, as fast
      as our astonishment would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running along the edge of the marsh, Higgs had covered about a hundred
      yards of the distance, when suddenly, charging straight at him out of the
      tall reeds, appeared a second lion, or rather lioness. Higgs wheeled
      round, and wildly fired the left barrel of his rifle without touching the
      infuriated brute. Next instant, to our horror, we saw him upon his back,
      with the lioness standing over him, lashing her tail, and growling.
    </p>
    <p>
      We shouted as we ran, and so did the Zeus, although they made no attempt
      at rescue, with the result that the lioness, instead of tearing Higgs to
      pieces, turned her head confusedly first to one side and then to the
      other. By now I, who had a long start of Orme, was quite close, say within
      thirty yards, though fire I dared not as yet, fearing lest, should I do
      so, I might kill my friend. At this moment the lioness, recovering her
      nerves, squatted down on the prostrate Higgs, and though he hit at her
      with his fists, dropped her muzzle, evidently with the intention of biting
      him through the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I felt that if I hesitated any more, all would be finished. The
      lioness was much longer than Higgs&mdash;a short, stout man&mdash;and her
      hind quarters projected beyond his feet. At these I aimed rapidly, and,
      pressing the trigger, next second heard the bullet clap upon the great
      beast&rsquo;s hide. Up she sprang with a roar, one hind leg dangling, and after
      a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, fled toward the sand-hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Orme, who was behind me, fired also, knocking up the dust beneath the
      lioness&rsquo;s belly, but although he had more cartridges in his rifle, which
      was a repeater, before either he or I could get another chance, it
      vanished behind a mound. Leaving it to go where it would, we ran on
      towards Higgs, expecting to find him either dead or badly mauled, but, to
      our amazement and delight, up jumped the Professor, his blue spectacles
      still on his nose, and, loading his rifle as he went, charged away after
      the wounded lioness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back,&rdquo; shouted the Captain as he followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for Joe!&rdquo; yelled Higgs in his high voice. &ldquo;If you fellows think that
      I&rsquo;m going to let a great cat sit on my stomach for nothing, you are jolly
      well mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the first rise the long-legged Orme caught him, but persuade
      him to return was more than he, or I when I arrived, could do. Beyond a
      scratch on his nose, which had stung him and covered him with blood, we
      found that he was quite uninjured, except in temper and dignity. But in
      vain did we beg him to be content with his luck and the honours he had
      won.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Adams wounded the beast, and I&rsquo;d rather kill two
      lions than one; also I have a score to square. But if you fellows are
      afraid, you go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, I confess I felt inclined to accept the invitation, but Orme, who
      was nettled, replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come; that settles the question, doesn&rsquo;t it? You must be shaken by
      your fall, or you would not talk like that, Higgs. Look, here runs the
      spoor&mdash;see the blood? Well, let&rsquo;s go steady and keep our wind. We may
      come on her anywhere, but don&rsquo;t you try any more long distance shots. You
      won&rsquo;t kill another lion at two hundred and fifty yards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Higgs, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be offended. I didn&rsquo;t mean anything,
      except that I am going to teach that beast the difference between a white
      man and a Zeu.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we began our march, following the blood tracks up and down the steep
      sand-slopes. When we had been at it for about half-an-hour our spirits
      were cheered by catching sight of the lioness on a ridge five hundred
      yards away. Just then, too, some of the Zeus overtook us and joined the
      hunt, though without zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as the day grew, the heat increased until it was so intense
      that the hot air danced above the sand slopes like billions of midges, and
      this although the sun was not visible, being hidden by a sort of mist. A
      strange silence, unusual even in the desert, pervaded the earth and sky;
      we could hear the grains of sand trickling from the ridges. The Zeus, who
      accompanied us, grew uneasy, and pointed upward with their spears, then
      behind toward the oasis of which we had long lost sight. Finally, when we
      were not looking, they disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I would have followed them, guessing that they had some good reason
      for this sudden departure. But Higgs refused to come, and Orme, in whom
      his foolish taunt seemed still to rankle, only shrugged his shoulders and
      said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the black curs go,&rdquo; exclaimed the Professor as he polished his blue
      spectacles and mopped his face. &ldquo;They are a white-livered lot of sneaks.
      Look! There she is, creeping off to the left. If we run round that
      sand-hill we shall meet her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we ran round the sand-hill, but we did not meet her, although after
      long hunting we struck the blood spoor afresh, and followed it for several
      miles, first in this direction, and then in that, until Orme and I
      wondered at Higgs&rsquo;s obstinacy and endurance. At length, when even he was
      beginning to despair, we put up the lioness in a hollow, and fired several
      shots at her as she hobbled over the opposing slope, one of which hit her,
      for she rolled over, then picked herself up again, roaring. As a matter of
      fact, it came from the Captain&rsquo;s rifle, but Higgs, who, like many an
      inexperienced person was a jealous sportsman, declared that it was his and
      we did not think it worth while to contradict him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On we toiled, and, just beyond the ridge, walked straight into the
      lioness, sitting up like a great dog, so injured that she could do nothing
      but snarl hideously and paw at the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it is my turn, old lady,&rdquo; ejaculated Higgs, and straightway missed
      her clean from a distance of five yards. A second shot was more
      successful, and she rolled over, dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; said the exultant Professor, &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll skin her. She sat on
      me, and I mean to sit on her for many a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we began the job, although I, who had large experience of this desert,
      and did not like the appearance of the weather, wished to leave the beast
      where it lay and get back to the oasis. It proved long, for I was the only
      one of us who had any practical knowledge of flaying animals, and in that
      heat extremely unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length it was done, and, having doubled the hide over a rifle for two
      of us to carry in turns, we refreshed ourselves from the water-bottles (I
      even caught the Professor washing the blood off his face and hands with
      some of the precious fluid). Then we started for the oasis, only to
      discover, though we were all sure that we knew the way, that not one of us
      had a slightest idea of its real direction. In the hurry of our departure
      we had forgotten to bring a compass, and the sun, that would have been our
      guide in ordinary circumstances, and to which we always trusted in the
      open desert, was hidden by the curious haze that has been described.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, sensibly enough, we determined to return to the sand crest where we
      had killed the lioness, and then trace our own footprints backward. This
      seemed simple enough, for there, within half-a-mile, rose the identical
      ridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached it, grumbling, for the lion-skin was heavy, only to discover
      that it was a totally different ridge. Now, after reflection and argument,
      we saw our exact mistake, and made for what was obviously the real ridge&mdash;with
      the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were lost in the desert!

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DEATH WIND
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said Higgs presently, speaking with the air of an oracle,
      &ldquo;the fact is that all these accursed sand-hills are as like each other as
      mummy beads on the same necklace, and therefore it is very difficult to
      know them apart. Give me that water-bottle, Adams; I am as dry as a
      lime-kiln.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said shortly; &ldquo;you may be drier before the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Oh! I see; but that&rsquo;s nonsense; those Zeus will hunt us
      up, or, at the worst, we have only to wait till the sun gets out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, suddenly the air became filled with a curious singing sound
      impossible to describe, caused as I knew, who had often heard it before,
      by millions and millions of particles of sand being rubbed together. We
      turned to see whence it came, and perceived, far away, rushing towards us
      with extraordinary swiftness, a huge and dense cloud preceded by isolated
      columns and funnels of similar clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A sand-storm,&rdquo; said Higgs, his florid face paling a little. &ldquo;Bad luck for
      us! That&rsquo;s what comes of getting out of bed the wrong side first this
      morning. No, it&rsquo;s your fault, Adams; you helped me to salt last night, in
      spite of my remonstrances&rdquo; (the Professor has sundry little superstitions
      of this sort, particularly absurd in so learned a man). &ldquo;Well, what shall
      we do? Get under the lee of the hill until it blows over?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t suppose it will blow over. Can&rsquo;t see anything to do except say our
      prayers,&rdquo; remarked Orme with sweet resignation. Oliver is, I think, the
      coolest hand in an emergency of any one I ever met, except, perhaps,
      Sergeant Quick, a man, of course, nearly old enough to be his father. &ldquo;The
      game seems to be pretty well up,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;Well, you have killed two
      lions, Higgs, and that is something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hang it! You can die if you like, Oliver. The world won&rsquo;t miss you;
      but think of its loss if anything happened to <i>me</i>. I don&rsquo;t intend to
      be wiped out by a beastly sand-storm. I intend to live to write a book on
      Mur,&rdquo; and Higgs shook his fist at the advancing clouds with an air that
      was really noble. It reminded me of Ajax defying the lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I had been reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Our only chance is to stop where we are, for if we move
      we shall certainly be buried alive. Look; there is something solid to lie
      on,&rdquo; and I pointed to a ridge of rock, a kind of core of congealed sand,
      from which the surface had been swept by gales. &ldquo;Down with you, quick,&rdquo; I
      went on, &ldquo;and let&rsquo;s draw that lion-skin over our heads. It may help to
      keep the dust from choking us. Hurry, men; it&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coming, it was indeed, with a mighty, wailing roar. Scarcely had we got
      ourselves into position, our backs to the blast and our mouths and noses
      buried after the fashion of camels in a similar predicament, the lion-skin
      covering our heads and bodies to the middle, with the paws tucked securely
      beneath us to prevent it from being blown away, when the storm leaped upon
      us furiously, bringing darkness in its train. There we lay for hour after
      hour, unable to see, unable to talk because of the roaring noise about us,
      and only from time to time lifting ourselves a little upon our hands and
      knees to disturb the weight of sand that accumulated on our bodies, lest
      it should encase us in a living tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dreadful were the miseries we suffered&mdash;the misery of the heat
      beneath the stinking pelt of the lion, the misery of the dust-laden air
      that choked us almost to suffocation, the misery of thirst, for we could
      not get at our scanty supply of water to drink. But worst of all perhaps,
      was the pain caused by the continual friction of the sharp sand driven
      along at hurricane speed, which, incredible as it may seem, finally wore
      holes in our thin clothing and filed our skins to rawness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder the Egyptian monuments get such a beautiful shine on them,&rdquo; I
      heard poor Higgs muttering in my ear again and again, for he was growing
      light-headed; &ldquo;no wonder, no wonder! My shin-bones will be very useful to
      polish Quick&rsquo;s tall riding-boots. Oh! curse the lions. Why did you help me
      to salt, you old ass; why did you help me to salt? It&rsquo;s pickling me
      behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he became quite incoherent, and only groaned from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps, however, this suffering did us a service, since otherwise
      exhaustion, thirst, and dust might have overwhelmed our senses, and caused
      us to fall into a sleep from which we never should have awakened. Yet at
      the time we were not grateful to it, for at last the agony became almost
      unbearable. Indeed, Orme told me afterwards that the last thing he could
      remember was a quaint fancy that he had made a colossal fortune by selling
      the secret of a new torture to the Chinese&mdash;that of hot sand driven
      on to the victim by a continuous blast of hot air.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while we lost count of time, nor was it until later that we
      learned that the storm endured for full twenty hours, during the latter
      part of which, notwithstanding our manifold sufferings, we must have
      become more or less insensible. At any rate, at one moment I remembered
      the awful roar and the stinging of the sand whips, followed by a kind of
      vision of the face of my son&mdash;that beloved, long-lost son whom I had
      sought for so many years, and for whose sake I endured all these things.
      Then, without any interval, as it were, I felt my limbs being scorched as
      though by hot irons or through a burning-glass, and with a fearful effort
      staggered up to find that the storm had passed, and that the furious sun
      was blistering my excoriated skin. Rubbing the caked dirt from my eyes, I
      looked down to see two mounds like those of graves, out of which projected
      legs that had been white. Just then one pair of legs, the longer pair,
      stirred, the sand heaved up convulsively, and, uttering wandering words in
      a choky voice, there arose the figure of Oliver Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment we stood and stared at each other, and strange spectacles we
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he dead?&rdquo; muttered Orme, pointing to the still buried Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fear so,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ll look;&rdquo; and painfully we began to
      disinter him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we came to it beneath the lion-skin, the Professor&rsquo;s face was black
      and hideous to see, but, to our relief, we perceived that he was not dead,
      for he moved his hand and moaned. Orme looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water would save him,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the anxious moment. One of our water-bottles was emptied before
      the storm began, but the other, a large, patent flask covered with felt,
      and having a screw vulcanite top, should still contain a good quantity,
      perhaps three quarts&mdash;that is, if the fluid had not evaporated in the
      dreadful heat. If this had happened, it meant that Higgs would die, and
      unless help came, that soon we should follow him. Orme unscrewed the
      flask, for my hands refused that office, and used his teeth to draw the
      cork, which, providentially enough the thoughtful Quick had set in the
      neck beneath the screw. Some of the water, which, although it was quite
      hot, had <i>not</i> evaporated, thank God! flew against his parched lips,
      and I saw him bite them till the blood came in the fierceness of the
      temptation to assuage his raging thirst. But he resisted it like the man
      he is, and, without drinking a drop, handed me the bottle, saying simply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the oldest; take care of this, Adams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now it was my turn to be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down,
      laid Higgs&rsquo;s head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let a little of the
      water trickle between his swollen lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect was magical, for in less than a minute the Professor sat up,
      grasped at the flask with both hands, and strove to tear it away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You cruel brute! You cruel selfish brute!&rdquo; he moaned as I wrenched it
      from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Higgs,&rdquo; I answered thickly; &ldquo;Orme and I want water badly
      enough, and we have had none. But you might take it all if it would save
      you, only it wouldn&rsquo;t. We are lost in the desert, and must be sparing. If
      you drank everything now, in a few hours you would be thirsty again and
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought awhile, then looked up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg pardon&mdash;I understand. I&rsquo;m the selfish brute. But there&rsquo;s a good
      lot of water there; let&rsquo;s each have a drink; we can&rsquo;t move unless we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we drank, measuring out the water in a little india-rubber cup which we
      had with us. It held about as much as a port wine glass, and each of us
      drank, or rather slowly sipped, three cupfuls; we who felt as though we
      could have swallowed a gallon apiece, and asked for more. Small as was the
      allowance, it worked wonders in us; we were men again.
    </p>
    <p>
      We stood up and looked about us, but the great storm had changed
      everything. Where there had been sand-hills a hundred feet high, now were
      plains and valleys; where there had been valleys appeared sand-hills. Only
      the high ridge upon which we had lain was as before, because it stood
      above the others and had a core of rock. We tried to discover the
      direction of the oasis by the position of the sun, only to be baffled,
      since our two watches had run down, and we did not know the time of day or
      where the sun ought to be in the heavens. Also, in that howling wilderness
      there was nothing to show us the points of the compass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higgs, whose obstinacy remained unimpaired, whatever may have happened to
      the rest of his vital forces, had one view of the matter, and Orme another
      diametrically opposed to it. They even argued as to whether the oasis lay
      to our right or to our left, for their poor heads were so confused that
      they were scarcely capable of accurate thought or observation. Meanwhile I
      sat down upon the sand and considered. Through the haze I could see the
      points of what I thought must be the hills whence the Zeus declared that
      the lions came, although of course, for aught I knew, they might be other
      hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;if lions live upon those hills, there must be water
      there. Let us try to reach them; perhaps we shall see the oasis as we go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then began our dreadful march. The lion-skin that had saved our lives, and
      was now baked hard as a board, we left behind, but the rifles we took. All
      day long we dragged ourselves up and down steep sand-slopes, pausing now
      again to drink a sip of water, and hoping always that from the top of the
      next slope we should see a rescue party headed by Quick, or perhaps the
      oasis itself. Indeed, once we did see it, green and shining, not more than
      three miles away, but when we got to the head of the hill beyond which it
      should lie we found that the vision was only a mirage, and our hearts
      nearly broke with disappointment. Oh! to men dying of thirst, that mirage
      was indeed a cruel mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length night approached, and the mountains were yet a long way off. We
      could march no more, and sank down exhausted, lying on our faces, because
      our backs were so cut by the driving sand and blistered by the sun that we
      could not sit. By now almost all our water was gone. Suddenly Higgs nudged
      us and pointed upwards. Following the line of his hand, we saw, not thirty
      yards away and showing clear against the sky, a file of antelopes trekking
      along the sand-ridge, doubtless on a night journey from one pasturage to
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows shoot,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;I might miss and frighten them away,&rdquo;
       for in his distress poor Higgs was growing modest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Orme and I drew ourselves to our knees, cocking our rifles. By this
      time all the buck save one had passed; there were but six of them, and
      this one marched along about twenty yards behind the others. Orme pulled
      the trigger, but his rifle would not go off because, as he discovered
      afterwards, some sand had worked into the mechanism of the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile I had also covered the buck, but the sunset dazzled my weakened
      eyes, and my arms were feeble; also my terrible anxiety for success, since
      I knew that on this shot hung our lives, unnerved me. But it must be now
      or never; in three more paces the beast would be down the dip.
    </p>
    <p>
      I fired, and knowing that I had missed, turned sick and faint. The
      antelope bounded forward a few yards right to the edge of the dip; then,
      never having heard such a sound before, and being overcome by some fatal
      curiosity, stopped and turned around, staring at the direction whence it
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despairingly I fired again, almost without taking aim, and this time the
      bullet went in beneath the throat, and, raking the animal, dropped it dead
      as a stone. We scrambled to it, and presently were engaged in an awful
      meal of which we never afterwards liked to think. Happily for us that
      antelope must have drunk water not long before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hunger and thirst assuaged after this horrible fashion, we slept
      awhile by the carcase, then arose extraordinarily refreshed, and, having
      cut off some hunks of meat to carry with us, started on again. By the
      position of the stars, we now knew that the oasis must lie somewhere to
      the east of us; but as between us and it there appeared to be nothing but
      these eternal sand-hills stretching away for many miles, and as in front
      of us toward the range the character of the desert seemed to be changing,
      we thought it safer, if the word safety can be used in such a connection,
      to continue to head for that range. All the remainder of this night we
      marched, and, as we had no fuel wherewith to cook it, at dawn ate some of
      the raw meat, which we washed down with the last drops of our water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we were out of the sand-hills, and had entered on a great pebbly plain
      that lay between us and the foot of the mountains. These looked quiet
      close, but in fact were still far off. Feebly and ever more feebly we
      staggered on, meeting no one and finding no water, though here and there
      we came across little bushes, of which we chewed the stringy and aromatic
      leaves that contained some moisture, but drew up our mouths and throats
      like alum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higgs, who was the softest of us, gave out the first, though to the last
      he struggled forward with surprising pluck, even after he had been obliged
      to throw away his rifle, because he could no longer carry it, though this
      we did not notice at the time. When he could not support himself upon his
      feet, Orme took him by one arm, and I by the other, and helped him on,
      much as I have seen two elephants do by a wounded companion of the herd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour or so later my strength failed me also. Although advanced in
      years, I am tough and accustomed to the desert and hardships; who would
      not be who had been a slave to the Khalifa? But now I could do no more,
      and halting, begged the others to go on and leave me. Orme&rsquo;s only answer
      was to proffer me his left arm. I took it, for life is sweet to us all,
      especially when one has something to live for&mdash;a desire to fulfil as
      I had, though to tell the truth, even at the time I felt ashamed of
      myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, then, we proceeded awhile, resembling a sober man attempting to lead
      two drunken friends out of reach of that stern policeman, Death. Orme&rsquo;s
      strength must be wonderful; or was it his great spirit and his tender pity
      for our helplessness which enabled him to endure beneath this double
      burden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he fell down as though he had been shot, and lay there senseless.
      The Professor, however, retained some portion of his mind, although it
      wandered. He became light-headed, and rambled on about our madness in
      having undertaken such a journey, &ldquo;just to pot a couple of beastly lions,&rdquo;
       and although I did not answer them, I agreed heartily with his remarks.
      Then he seemed to imagine that I was a clergyman, and kneeling on the
      sand, he made a lengthy confession of his sins which, so far as I
      gathered, though I did not pay much attention to them, for I was thinking
      of my own, appeared chiefly to consist of the unlawful acquisition of
      certain objects of antiquity, or of having overmatched others in the
      purchase of such objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      To pacify him, for I feared lest he should go raving mad, I pronounced
      some religious absolution, whereon poor Higgs rolled over and lay still by
      Orme. Yes; he, the friend whom I had always loved, for his very failings
      were endearing, was dead or at the point of death, like the gallant young
      man at his side, and I myself was dying. Tremors shook my limbs; horrible
      waves of blackness seemed to well up from my vitals, through my breast to
      my brain, and thence to evaporate in queer, jagged lines and patches,
      which I realized, but could not actually see. Gay memories of my far-off
      childhood arose in me, particularly those of a Christmas party where I had
      met a little girl dressed like an elf, a little girl with blue eyes whom I
      had loved dearly for quite a fortnight, to be beaten down, stamped out,
      swallowed by that vision of the imminent shadow which awaits all mankind,
      the black womb of a re-birth, if re-birth there be.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could I do? I thought of lighting a fire; at any rate it would serve
      to scare the lions and other wild beasts which else might prey upon us
      before we were quite dead. It would be dreadful to lie helpless but
      sentient, and feel their rending fangs. But I had no strength to collect
      the material. To do so at best must have meant a long walk, for even here
      it was not plentiful. I had a few cartridges left&mdash;three, to be
      accurate&mdash;in my repeating rifle; the rest I had thrown away to be rid
      of their weight. I determined to fire them, since, in my state I thought
      they could no longer serve either to win food or for the purposes of
      defence, although, as it happened, in this I was wrong. It was possible
      that, even in that endless desert, some one might hear the shots, and if
      not&mdash;well, good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I sat up and fired the first cartridge, wondering in a childish fashion
      where the bullet would fall. Then I went to sleep for awhile. The howling
      of a hyena woke me up, and, on glancing around, I saw the beast&rsquo;s flaming
      eyes quite close to me. I aimed and shot at it, and heard a yell of pain.
      That hyena, I reflected, would want no more food at present.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence of the desert overwhelmed me; it was so terrible that I almost
      wished the hyena back for company. Holding the rifle above my head, I
      fired the third cartridge. Then I took the hand of Higgs in my own, for,
      after all, it was a link&mdash;the last link with humanity and the world&mdash;and
      lay down in the company of death that seemed to fall upon me in black and
      smothering veils.
    </p>
    <p>
      I woke up and became aware that some one was pouring water down my throat.
      Heaven! I thought to myself, for at that time heaven and water were
      synonymous in my mind. I drank a good deal of it, not all I wanted by any
      means, but as much as the pourer would allow, then raised myself upon my
      hands and looked. The starlight was extraordinarily clear in that pure
      desert atmosphere, and by it I saw the face of Sergeant Quick bending over
      me. Also, I saw Orme sitting up, staring about him stupidly, while a great
      yellow dog, with a head like a mastiff, licked his hand. I knew the dog at
      once; it was that which Orme had bought from some wandering natives, and
      named Pharaoh because he ruled over all other dogs. Moreover, I knew the
      two camels that stood near by. So I was still on earth&mdash;unless,
      indeed we had all moved on a step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you find us, Sergeant?&rdquo; I asked feebly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t find you, Doctor,&rdquo; answered Quick, &ldquo;dog Pharaoh found you. In a
      business like this a dog is more useful than man, for he can smell what
      one can&rsquo;t see. Now, if you feel better, Doctor, please look at Mr. Higgs,
      for I fear he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I looked, and, although I did not say so, was of the same opinion. His jaw
      had fallen, and he lay limp and senseless; his eyes I could not see,
      because of the black spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Water,&rdquo; I said, and Quick poured some into his mouth, where it vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he did not stir, so I opened his garments and felt his heart. At
      first I could detect nothing; then there was the slightest possible
      flutter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s hope,&rdquo; I said in answer to the questioning looks. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
      happen to have any brandy, do you?&rdquo; I added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never travelled without it yet, Doctor,&rdquo; replied Quick indignantly,
      producing a metal flask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him some,&rdquo; I said, and the Sergeant obeyed with liberality and
      almost instantaneous effect, for Higgs sat up gasping and coughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy; filthy stuff; teetotaller! Cursed trick! Never forgive you.
      Water, water,&rdquo; he spluttered in a thick, low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We gave it to him, and he drank copiously, until we would let him have no
      more indeed. Then, by degrees, his senses came back to him. He thrust up
      his black spectacles which he had worn all this while, and stared at the
      Sergeant with his sharp eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So we are not dead, after all, which perhaps is
      a pity after getting through the beastly preliminaries. What has
      happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t quite know,&rdquo; answered Orme; &ldquo;ask Quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Sergeant was already engaged in lighting a little fire and setting
      a camp-kettle to boil, into which he poured a tin of beef extract that he
      had brought with other eatables from our stores on the chance that he
      might find us. In fifteen minutes we were drinking soup, for I forbade
      anything more solid as yet, and, oh! what a blessed meal was that. When it
      was finished, Quick fetched some blankets from the camels, which he threw
      over us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lie down and sleep, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;Pharaoh and I will watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last thing I remember was seeing the Sergeant, in his own fashion an
      extremely religious man, and not ashamed of it, kneeling upon the sand and
      apparently saying his prayers. As he explained afterwards, of course, as a
      fatalist, he knew well that whatever must happen would happen, but still
      he considered it right and proper to return thanks to the Power which had
      arranged that on this occasion the happenings should be good, and not ill,
      a sentiment with which every one of us agreed. Opposite to him, with one
      of his faithful eyes fixed on Orme, sat Pharaoh in grave contemplation.
      Doubtless, being an Eastern dog, he understood the meaning of public
      prayer; or perhaps he thought that he should receive some share of
      gratitude and thanks.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we awoke the sun was already high, and to show us that we had dreamed
      no dream, there was Quick frying tinned bacon over the fire, while Pharaoh
      sat still and watched him&mdash;or the bacon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Orme to me, pointing to the mountains, &ldquo;they are still miles
      away. It was madness to think that we could reach them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, then turned to stare at Higgs, who was just waking up, for,
      indeed, he was a sight to see. His fiery red hair was full of sand, his
      nether garments were gone, apparently at some stage in our march he had
      dispensed with the remains of them because they chafed his sore limbs, and
      his fair skin, not excluding that of his face, was a mass of blisters,
      raised by the sun. In fact he was so disfigured that his worst enemy would
      not have known him. He yawned, stretched himself, always a good sign in
      man or beast, and asked for a bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you will have to wash yourself in sand here, sir, like them
      filthy Arabians,&rdquo; said Quick, saluting. &ldquo;No water to spare for baths in
      this dry country. But I&rsquo;ve got a tube of hazeline, also a hair-brush and a
      looking-glass,&rdquo; he added, producing these articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Higgs, as he took them; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s sacrilege to
      think of using water to wash. I intend never to waste it in that way
      again.&rdquo; Then he looked at himself in the glass, and let it fall upon the
      sand, ejaculating, &ldquo;Oh! good Lord, is that me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please be careful, sir,&rdquo; said the Sergeant sternly; &ldquo;you told me the
      other day that it&rsquo;s unlucky to break a looking-glass; also I have no
      other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it away,&rdquo; said the Professor; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it any more, and,
      Doctor, come and oil my face, there&rsquo;s a good fellow; yes, and the rest of
      me also, if there is enough hazeline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we treated each other with the ointment, which at first made us smart
      fearfully, and then, very gingerly sat down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Orme, as he finished his fifth pannikin of tea,
      &ldquo;tell us your story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t much of a story, Captain. Those Zeu fellows came back without
      you, and, not knowing the lingo, I could make nothing of their tale. Well,
      I soon made Shadrach and Co. understand that, death-wind or no death-wind&mdash;that&rsquo;s
      what they call it&mdash;they must come with me to look for you, and at
      last we started, although they said that I was mad, as you were dead
      already. Indeed, it wasn&rsquo;t until I asked that fellow Shadrach if he wanted
      to be dead too&rdquo;&mdash;and the Sergeant tapped his revolver grimly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      he would let any one go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it proved, he was right, for we couldn&rsquo;t find you, and after awhile
      the camels refused to face the storm any longer; also one of the Abati
      drivers was lost, and hasn&rsquo;t been heard of since. It was all the rest of
      us could do to get back to the oasis alive, nor would Shadrach go out
      again even after the storm had blown itself away. It was no use arguing
      with the pig, so, as I did not want his blood upon my hands, I took two
      camels and started with the dog Pharaoh for company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now this was my thought, although I could not explain it to the Abati
      crowd, that if you lived at all, you would almost certainly head for the
      hills as I knew you had no compass, and you would not be able to see
      anything else. So I rode along the plain which stretches between the
      desert and the mountains, keeping on the edge of the sand-hills. I rode
      all day, but when night came I halted, since I could see no more. There I
      sat in that great place, thinking, and after an hour or two I observed
      Pharaoh prick his ears and look toward the west. So I also started toward
      the west, and presently I thought that I saw one faint streak of light
      which seemed to go upward, and therefore couldn&rsquo;t come from a falling
      star, but might have come from a rifle fired toward the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I listened, but no sound reached me, only presently, some seconds
      afterwards, the dog again pricked his ears as though <i>he</i> heard
      something. That settled me, and I mounted and rode forward through the
      night toward the place where I thought I had seen the flash. For two hours
      I rode, firing my revolver from time to time; then as no answer came, gave
      it up as a bad job, and stopped. But Pharaoh there wouldn&rsquo;t stop. He began
      to whine and sniff and run forward, and at last bolted into the darkness,
      out of which presently I heard him barking some hundreds of yards away, to
      call me, I suppose. So I followed and found you three gentlemen, dead, as
      I thought at first. That&rsquo;s all the story, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One with a good end, anyway, Sergeant. We owe our lives to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg your pardon, Captain,&rdquo; answered Quick modestly; &ldquo;not to me at all,
      but to Providence first that arranged everything, before we were born
      perhaps, and next to Pharaoh. He&rsquo;s a wise dog, Pharaoh, though fierce with
      some, and you did a good deal when you bought him for a bottle of whisky
      and a sixpenny pocket-knife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was dawn on the following morning before we sighted the oasis, whither
      we could travel but slowly, since, owing to the lack of camels, two of us
      must walk. Of these two, as may be guessed, the Sergeant was always one
      and his master the other, for of all the men I ever knew I think that in
      such matters Orme is the most unselfish. Nothing would induce him to mount
      one of the camels, even for half-an-hour, so that when I walked, the brute
      went riderless. On the other hand, once he was on, notwithstanding the
      agonies he suffered from his soreness, nothing would induce Higgs to get
      off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am and here I stop,&rdquo; he said several times, in English, French,
      and sundry Oriental languages. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tramped it enough to last me the rest
      of my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Both of us were dozing upon our saddles when suddenly I heard the Sergeant
      calling to the camels to halt and asked what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looks like Arabians, Doctor,&rdquo; he said, pointing to a cloud of dust
      advancing toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if so,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;our best chance is to show no fear and go on.
      I don&rsquo;t think they will harm us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So, having made ready such weapons as we had, we advanced, Orme and the
      Sergeant walking between the two camels, until presently we encountered
      the other caravan, and, to our astonishment, saw none other than Shadrach
      riding at the head of it, mounted on my dromedary, which his own mistress,
      the Lady of the Abati, had given to me. We came face to face, and halted,
      staring at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the beard of Aaron! is it you, lords?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;We thought you were
      dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the hair of Moses! so I gather,&rdquo; I answered angrily, &ldquo;seeing that you
      are going off with all our belongings,&rdquo; and I pointed to the baggage
      camels laden with goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed explanations and voluble apologies, which Higgs for one
      accepted with a very bad grace. Indeed, as he can talk Arabic and its
      dialects perfectly, he made use of that tongue to pour upon the heads of
      Shadrach and his companions a stream of Eastern invective that must have
      astonished them, ably seconded as it was by Sergeant Quick in English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orme listened for some time, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do, old fellow; if you go on, you will get up a row, and,
      Sergeant, be good enough to hold your tongue. We have met them, so there
      is no harm done. Now, friend Shadrach, turn back with us to the oasis. We
      are going to rest there for some days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach looked sulky, and said something about our turning and going on
      with <i>them</i>, whereon I produced the ancient ring, Sheba&rsquo;s ring, which
      I had brought as a token from Mur. This I held before his eyes, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Disobey, and there will be an account to settle when you come into the
      presence of her who sent you forth, for even if we four should die&rdquo;&mdash;and
      I looked at him meaningly&mdash;&ldquo;think not that you will be able to hide
      this matter; there are too many witnesses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, without more words, he saluted the sacred ring, and we all went back
      to Zeu.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      PHARAOH MAKES TROUBLE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Another six weeks or so had gone by, and at length the character of the
      country began to change. At last we were passing out of the endless desert
      over which we had travelled for so many hundreds of miles; at least a
      thousand, according to our observations and reckonings, which I checked by
      those that I had taken upon my eastward journey. Our march, after the
      great adventure at the oasis, was singularly devoid of startling events.
      Indeed, it had been awful in its monotony, and yet, oddly enough, not
      without a certain charm&mdash;at any rate for Higgs and Orme, to whom the
      experience was new.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day to travel on across an endless sea of sand so remote, so
      unvisited that for whole weeks no man, not even a wandering Bedouin of the
      desert, crossed our path. Day by day to see the great red sun rise out of
      the eastern sands, and, its journey finished, sink into the western sands.
      Night by night to watch the moon, the same moon on which were fixed the
      million eyes of cities, turning those sands to a silver sea, or, in that
      pure air, to observe the constellations by which we steered our path
      making their majestic march through space. And yet to know that this vast
      region, now so utterly lonesome and desolate, had once been familiar to
      the feet of long-forgotten men who had trod the sands we walked, and dug
      the wells at which we drank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armies had marched across these deserts, also, and perished there. For
      once we came to a place where a recent fearful gale had almost denuded the
      underlying rock, and there found the skeletons of thousands upon thousands
      of soldiers, with those of their beasts of burden, and among them heads of
      arrows, sword-blades, fragments of armour and of painted wooden shields.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here a whole host had died; perhaps Alexander sent it forth, or perhaps
      some far earlier monarch whose name has ceased to echo on the earth. At
      least they had died, for there we saw the memorial of that buried
      enterprise. There lay the kings, the captains, the soldiers, and the
      concubines, for I found the female bones heaped apart, some with the long
      hair still upon the skulls, showing where the poor, affrighted women had
      hived together in the last catastrophe of slaughter or of famine, thirst,
      and driven sand. Oh, if only those bones could speak, what a tale was
      theirs to tell!
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been cities in this desert, too, where once were oases, now
      overwhelmed, except perhaps for a sand-choked spring. Twice we came upon
      the foundations of such places, old walls of clay or stone, stark
      skeletons of ancient homes that the shifting sands had disinterred, which
      once had been the theatre of human hopes and fears, where once men had
      been born, loved, and died, where once maidens had been fair, and good and
      evil wrestled, and little children played. Some Job may have dwelt here
      and written his immortal plaint, or some king of Sodom, and suffered the
      uttermost calamity. The world is very old; all we Westerns learned from
      the contemplation of these wrecks of men and of their works was just that
      the world is very old.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening against the clear sky there appeared the dim outline of
      towering cliffs, shaped like a horseshoe. They were the Mountains of Mur
      many miles away, but still the Mountains of Mur, sighted at last. Next
      morning we began to descend through wooded land toward a wide river that
      is, I believe, a tributary of the Nile, though upon this point I have no
      certain information. Three days later we reached the banks of this river,
      following some old road, and faring sumptuously all the way, since here
      there was much game and grass in plenty for the camels that, after their
      long abstinence, ate until we thought that they would burst. Evidently we
      had not arrived an hour too soon, for now the Mountains of Mur were hid by
      clouds, and we could see that it was raining upon the plains which lay
      between us and them. The wet season was setting in, and, had we been a
      single week later, it might have been impossible for us to cross the
      river, which would then have been in flood. As it was, we passed it
      without difficulty by the ancient ford, the water never rising above the
      knees of our camels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon its further bank we took counsel, for now we had entered the
      territory of the Fung, and were face to face with the real dangers of our
      journey. Fifty miles or so away rose the fortress of Mur, but, as I
      explained to my companions, the question was how to pass those fifty miles
      in safety. Shadrach was called to our conference, and at my request set
      out the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yonder, he said, rose the impregnable mountain home of the Abati, but all
      the vast plain included in the loop of the river which he called Ebur, was
      the home of the savage Fung race, whose warriors could be counted by the
      ten thousand, and whose principal city, Harmac, was built opposite to the
      stone effigy of their idol, that was also called Harmac&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harmac&mdash;that is Harmachis, god of dawn. Your Fung had something to
      do with the old Egyptians, or both of them came from a common stock,&rdquo;
       interrupted Higgs triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay, old fellow,&rdquo; answered Orme; &ldquo;I think you told us that before
      in London; but we will go into the archæology afterwards if we survive to
      do so. Let Shadrach get on with his tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This city, which had quite fifty thousand inhabitants, continued Shadrach,
      commanded the mouth of the pass or cleft by which we must approach Mur,
      having probably been first built there for that very purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orme asked if there was no other way into the stronghold, which, he
      understood, the embassy had left by being let down a precipice. Shadrach
      answered that this was true, but that although the camels and their loads
      had been let down that precipitous place, owing to the formation of its
      overhanging rocks, it would be perfectly impossible to haul them up it
      with any tackle that the Abati possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked again if there was not a way round, if that circle of mountains
      had no back door. Shadrach replied that there was such a back door facing
      to the north some eight days&rsquo; journey away. Only at this season of the
      year it could not be reached, since beyond the Mountains of Mur in that
      direction was a great lake, out of which flowed the river Ebur in two arms
      that enclosed the whole plain of Fung. By now this lake would be full,
      swollen with rains that fell on the hills of Northern Africa, and the
      space between it and the Mur range nothing but an impassable swamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being still unsatisfied, Orme inquired whether, if we abandoned the
      camels, we could not then climb the precipice down which the embassy had
      descended. To this the answer, which I corroborated, was that if our
      approach were known and help given to us from above, it might be possible,
      provided that we threw away the loads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seeing what these loads are, and the purpose for which we have brought
      them so far, that is out of the question,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;Therefore, tell us
      at once, Shadrach, how we are to win through the Fung to Mur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In one way only, O son of Orme, should it be the will of God that we do
      so at all; by keeping ourselves hidden during the daytime and marching at
      night. According to their custom at this season, to-morrow, after sunset,
      the Fung hold their great spring feast in the city of Harmac, and at dawn
      go up to make sacrifice to their idol. But after sunset they eat and drink
      and are merry, and then it is their habit to withdraw their guards, that
      they may take part in the festival. For this reason I have timed our march
      that we should arrive on the night of this feast, which I know by the age
      of the moon, when, in the darkness, with God&rsquo;s help, perchance we may slip
      past Harmac, and at the first light find ourselves in the mouth of the
      road that runs up to Mur. Moreover, I will give warning to my people, the
      Abati, that we are coming, so that they may be at hand to help us if there
      is need.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By firing the reeds&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to the dense masses of dead
      vegetation about&mdash;&ldquo;as I arranged that I would do before we left Mur
      many months ago. The Fung, if they see it, will think only that it is the
      work of some wandering fisherman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orme shrugged his shoulders, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, friend Shadrach, you know the place and these people, and I do not,
      so we must do what you tell us. But I say at once that if, as I
      understand, yonder Fung will kill us if they can, to me your plan seems
      very dangerous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is dangerous,&rdquo; he answered, adding with a sneer, &ldquo;but I thought that
      you men of England were not cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cowards! you son of a dog!&rdquo; broke in Higgs in his high voice. &ldquo;How dare
      you talk to us like that? You see this man here&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed to
      Sergeant Quick, who, tall and upright, stood watching this scene grimly,
      and understanding most of what passed&mdash;&ldquo;well, he is the lowest among
      us&mdash;a servant only&rdquo; (here the Sergeant saluted), &ldquo;but I tell you that
      there is more courage in his little finger than in your whole body, or in
      that of all the Abati people, so far as I can make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the Sergeant saluted again, murmuring beneath his breath, &ldquo;I hope so,
      sir. Being a Christian, I hope so, but till it comes to the
      sticking-point, one can never be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You speak big words, O Higgs,&rdquo; answered Shadrach insolently, for, as I
      think I have said, he hated the Professor, who smelt the rogue in him, and
      scourged him continually with his sharp tongue, &ldquo;but if the Fung get hold
      of you, then we shall learn the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I punch his head, sir?&rdquo; queried Quick in a meditative voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet, please,&rdquo; interrupted Orme. &ldquo;We have troubles enough before us,
      without making more. It will be time to settle our quarrels when we have
      got through the Fung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Shadrach and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, this is no time for angry words. You are the guide of this party;
      lead us as you will, remembering only that if it comes to war, I, by the
      wish of my companions, am Captain. Also, there is another thing which you
      should not forget&mdash;namely, that in the end you must make answer to
      your own ruler, she who, I understand from the doctor here, is called
      Walda Nagasta, the Child of Kings. Now, no more words; we march as you
      wish and where you wish. On your head be it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Abati heard and bowed sullenly. Then, with a look of hate at Higgs, he
      turned and went about his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better to have let me punch his head,&rdquo; soliloquized Quick. &ldquo;It would
      have done him a world of good, and perhaps saved many troubles, for, to
      tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t trust that quarter-bred Hebrew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he departed to see to the camels and the guns while the rest of us
      went to our tents to get such sleep as the mosquitoes would allow. In my
      own case it was not much, since the fear of evil to come weighed upon me.
      Although I knew the enormous difficulty of entering the mountain
      stronghold of Mur by any other way, such as that by which I had quitted
      it, burdened as we were with our long train of camels laden with rifles,
      ammunition, and explosives, I dreaded the results of an attempt to pass
      through the Fung savages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, it occurred to me that Shadrach had insisted upon this route
      from a kind of jealous obstinacy, and to be in opposition to us
      Englishmen, whom he hated in his heart, or perhaps for some dark and
      secret reason. Still, the fact remained that we were in his power, since
      owing to the circumstances in which I had entered and left the place, it
      was impossible for me to act as guide to the party. If I attempted to do
      so, no doubt he and the Abati with him would desert, leaving the camels
      and their loads upon our hands. Why should they not, seeing that they
      would be quite safe in concluding that we should never have an opportunity
      of laying our side of the case before their ruler?
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as the sun was setting, Quick came to call me, saying that the camels
      were being loaded up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t much like the look of things, Doctor,&rdquo; he said as he helped me to
      pack my few belongings, &ldquo;for the fact is I can&rsquo;t trust that Shadrach man.
      His pals call him &lsquo;Cat,&rsquo; a good name for him, I think. Also, he is showing
      his claws just now, the truth being that he hates the lot of us, and would
      like to get back into Purr or Mur, or whatever the name of the place is,
      having lost us on the road. You should have seen the way he looked at the
      Professor just now. Oh! I wish the Captain had let me punch his head. I&rsquo;m
      sure it would have cleared the air a lot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it chanced, Shadrach was destined to get his head &ldquo;punched&rdquo; after all,
      but by another hand. It happened thus. The reeds were fired, as Shadrach
      had declared it was necessary to do, in order that the Abati watchmen on
      the distant mountains might see and report the signal, although in the
      light of subsequent events I am by no means certain that this warning was
      not meant for other eyes as well. Then, as arranged, we started out,
      leaving them burning in a great sheet of flame behind us, and all that
      night marched by the shine of the stars along some broken-down and
      undoubtedly ancient road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first sign of dawn we left this road and camped amid the overgrown
      ruins of a deserted town that had been built almost beneath the
      precipitous cliffs of Mur, fortunately without having met any one or being
      challenged. I took the first watch, while the others turned in to sleep
      after we had all breakfasted off cold meats, for here we dared not light a
      fire. As the sun grew high, dispelling the mists, I saw that we were
      entering upon a thickly-populated country which was no stranger to
      civilization of a sort. Below us, not more than fifteen or sixteen miles
      away, and clearly visible through my field-glasses, lay the great town of
      Harmac, which, during my previous visit to this land, I had never seen, as
      I passed it in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a city of the West Central African type, with open market-places
      and wide streets, containing thousands of white, flat-roofed houses, the
      most important of which were surrounded by gardens. Round it ran a high
      and thick wall, built, apparently, of sun-burnt brick, and in front of the
      gateways, of which I could see two, stood square towers whence these might
      be protected. All about this city the flat and fertile land was under
      cultivation, for the season being that of early spring, already the maize
      and other crops showed green upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond this belt of plough-lands, with the aid of the field-glasses, I
      could make out great herds of grazing cattle and horses, mixed with wild
      game, a fact that assured me of the truth of what I had heard during my
      brief visit to Mur, that the Fung had few or no firearms, since otherwise
      the buck and quagga would have kept at a distance. Far off, too, and even
      on the horizon, I saw what appeared to be other towns and villages.
      Evidently this was a very numerous people, and one which could not justly
      be described as savage. No wonder that the little Abati tribe feared them
      so intensely, notwithstanding the mighty precipices by which they were
      protected from their hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eleven o&rsquo;clock Orme came on watch, and I turned in, having nothing
      to report. Soon I was fast asleep, notwithstanding the anxieties that, had
      I been less weary, might well have kept me wakeful. For these were many.
      On the coming night we must slip through the Fung, and before midday on
      the morrow we should either have entered Mur, or failed to have entered
      Mur, which meant&mdash;death, or, what was worse, captivity among
      barbarians, and subsequent execution, preceded probably by torture of one
      sort or another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, however, we might come thither without accident, travelling
      with good guides on a dark night, for, after all, the place was big, and
      the road lonely and little used, so that unless we met a watch, which, we
      were told, would not be there, our little caravan had a good chance to
      pass unobserved. Shadrach seemed to think that we should do so, but the
      worst of it was that, like Quick, I did not trust Shadrach. Even Maqueda,
      the Lady of the Abati, she whom they called Child of Kings, had her doubts
      about him, or so it had seemed to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, she had told me before I left Mur that she chose him for this
      mission because he was bold and cunning, one of the very few of her people
      also who, in his youth, had crossed the desert and, therefore, knew the
      road. &ldquo;Yet, Physician,&rdquo; she added meaningly, &ldquo;watch him, for is he not
      named &lsquo;Cat&rsquo;? Yes, watch him, for did I not hold his wife and children
      hostages, and were I not sure that he desires to win the great reward in
      land which I have promised to him, I would not trust you to this man&rsquo;s
      keeping.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, after many experiences in his company, my opinion coincided with
      Maqueda&rsquo;s, and so did that of Quick, no mean judge of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at him, Doctor,&rdquo; he said when he came to tell me that I could turn
      in, for whether it were his watch or not, the Sergeant never seemed to be
      off duty. &ldquo;Look, at him,&rdquo; and he pointed to Shadrach, who was seated under
      the shade of a tree, talking earnestly in whispers with two of his
      subordinates with a very curious and unpleasing smile upon his face. &ldquo;If
      God Almighty ever made a scamp, he&rsquo;s squatting yonder. My belief is that
      he wanted to be rid of us all at Zeu, so that he might steal our goods,
      and I hope he won&rsquo;t play the same trick again to-night. Even the dog can&rsquo;t
      abide him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before I could answer, I had proof of this last statement, for the great
      yellow hound, Pharaoh, that had found us in the desert, hearing our
      voices, emerged from some corner where it was hidden, and advanced toward
      us, wagging its tail. As it passed Shadrach, it stopped and growled, the
      hair rising on its back, whereon he hurled a stone at it and hit its leg.
      Next instant Pharaoh, a beast of enormous power, was on the top of him,
      and really, I thought, about to tear out his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we got him off before any harm was done, but Shadrach&rsquo;s face, lined
      with its livid scars, was a thing to remember. Between rage and fear, it
      looked like that of a devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return. After this business I went to sleep, wondering if it were my
      last rest upon the earth, and whether, having endured so much for his
      sake, it would or would not be my fortune to see the face of my son again,
      if, indeed, he still lived, yonder not a score of miles away&mdash;or
      anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward evening I was awakened by a fearful hubbub, in which I
      distinguished the shrill voice of Higgs ejaculating language which I will
      not repeat, the baying of Pharaoh, and the smothered groans and curses of
      an Abati. Running from the little tent, I saw a curious sight, that of the
      Professor with Shadrach&rsquo;s head under his left arm, in chancery, as we used
      to call it at school, while with his right he punched the said Shadrach&rsquo;s
      nose and countenance generally with all his strength, which, I may add, is
      considerable. Close by, holding Pharaoh by the collar, which we had
      manufactured for him out of the skin of a camel that had died, stood
      Sergeant Quick, a look of grim amusement on his wooden face, while around,
      gesticulating after their Eastern fashion, and uttering guttural sounds of
      wrath, were several of the Abati drivers. Orme was absent, being, in fact,
      asleep at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, Higgs?&rdquo; I shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;you&mdash;see,&rdquo; he spluttered, accompanying each word with a
      blow on the unfortunate Shadrach&rsquo;s prominent nose. &ldquo;I am punching this
      fellow&rsquo;s beastly head. Ah! you&rsquo;d bite, would you? Then take that, and that
      and&mdash;that. Lord, how hard his teeth are. Well, I think he has had
      enough,&rdquo; and suddenly he released the Abati, who, a gory and most
      unpleasant spectacle, fell to the ground and lay there panting. His
      companions, seeing their chief&rsquo;s melancholy plight, advanced upon the
      Professor in a threatening fashion; indeed, one of them drew a knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put up that thing, sonny,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, &ldquo;or by heaven, I&rsquo;ll loose
      the dog upon you. Got your revolver handy, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently, if the man did not understand Quick&rsquo;s words, their purport was
      clear to him, for he sheathed his knife and fell back with the others.
      Shadrach, too, rose from the ground and went with them. At a distance of a
      few yards, however, he turned, and, glaring at Higgs out of his swollen
      eyes, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure, accursed Gentile, that I will remember and repay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, too, Orme arrived upon the scene, yawning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the deuce is the matter?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give five bob for a pint of iced stone ginger,&rdquo; replied Higgs
      inconsequently. Then he drank off a pannikin of warmish, muddy-coloured
      water which Quick gave to him, and handed it back, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, Sergeant; that&rsquo;s better than nothing, and cold drink is always
      dangerous if you are hot. What&rsquo;s the matter? Oh! not much. Shadrach tried
      to poison Pharaoh; that&rsquo;s all. I was watching him out of the corner of my
      eye, and saw him go to the strychnine tin, roll a bit of meat in it which
      he had first wetted, and throw it to the poor beast. I got hold of it in
      time, and chucked it over that wall, where you will find it if you care to
      look. I asked Shadrach why he had done such a thing. He answered, &lsquo;To keep
      the dog quiet while we are passing through the Fung,&rsquo; adding that anyhow
      it was a savage beast and best out of the way, as it had tried to bite him
      that morning. Then I lost my temper and went for the blackguard, and
      although I gave up boxing twenty years ago, very soon had the best of it,
      for, as you may have observed, no Oriental can fight with his fists.
      That&rsquo;s all. Give me another cup of water, Sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it may be,&rdquo; answered Orme, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;To tell the
      truth, old fellow, it would have been wiser to defer blacking Shadrach&rsquo;s
      eyes till we were safe in Mur. But it&rsquo;s no use talking now, and I daresay
      I should have done the same myself if I had seen him try to poison
      Pharaoh,&rdquo; and he patted the head of the great dog, of which we were all
      exceedingly fond, although in reality it only cared for Orme, merely
      tolerating the rest of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;perhaps you would try to patch up our guide&rsquo;s nose
      and soothe his feelings. You know him better than we do. Give him a rifle.
      No, don&rsquo;t do that, or he might shoot some one in the back&mdash;by
      accident done on purpose. Promise him a rifle when we get into Mur; I know
      he wants one badly, because I caught him trying to steal a carbine from
      the case. Promise him anything so long as you can square it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I went, taking a bottle of arnica and some court plaster with me, to
      find Shadrach surrounded by sympathizers and weeping with rage over the
      insult, which, he said, had been offered to his ancient and distinguished
      race in his own unworthy person. I did my best for him physically and
      mentally, pointing out, as I dabbed the arnica on his sadly disfigured
      countenance, that he had brought the trouble on himself, seeing that he
      had really no business to poison Pharaoh because he had tried to bite him.
      He answered that his reason for wishing to kill the dog was quite
      different, and repeated at great length what he had told the Professor&mdash;namely,
      that it might betray us while we were passing through the Fung. Also he
      went on so venomously about revenge that I thought it time to put a stop
      to the thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, Shadrach,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;unless you unsay those words and make peace
      at once, you shall be bound and tried. Perhaps we shall have a better
      chance of passing safely through the Fung if we leave you dead behind us
      than if you accompany us as a living enemy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this, he changed his note altogether, saying that he saw he had
      been wrong. Moreover, so soon as his injuries were dressed, he sought out
      Higgs, whose hand he kissed with many apologies, vowing that he had
      forgotten everything and that his heart toward him was like that of a twin
      brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, friend,&rdquo; answered Higgs, who never bore malice, &ldquo;only don&rsquo;t
      try to poison Pharaoh again, and, for my part, I&rsquo;ll promise not to
      remember this matter when we get to Mur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite a converted character, ain&rsquo;t he, Doctor?&rdquo; sarcastically remarked
      Quick, who had been watching this edifying scene. &ldquo;Nasty Eastern temper
      all gone; no Hebrew talk of eye for eye or tooth for tooth, but kisses the
      fist that smote him in the best Christian spirit. All the same, I wouldn&rsquo;t
      trust the swine further than I could kick him, especially in the dark,
      which,&rdquo; he added meaningly, &ldquo;is what it will be to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I made no answer to the Sergeant, for although I agreed with him, there
      was nothing to be done, and talking about a bad business would only make
      it worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      By now the afternoon drew towards night&mdash;a very stormy night, to
      judge from the gathering clouds and rising wind. We were to start a little
      after sundown, that is, within an hour, and, having made ready my own
      baggage and assisted Higgs with his, we went to look for Orme and Quick,
      whom we found very busy in one of the rooms of an unroofed house. To all
      appearance they were engaged, Quick in sorting pound tins of tobacco or
      baking-powder, and Orme in testing an electric battery and carefully
      examining coils of insulated wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your game?&rdquo; asked the Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better than yours, old boy, when Satan taught your idle hands to punch
      Shadrach&rsquo;s head. But perhaps you had better put that pipe out. These
      azo-imide compounds are said to burn rather more safely than coal. Still,
      one never knows; the climate or the journey may have changed their
      constitution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Higgs retreated hurriedly, to a distance of fifty yards indeed, whence he
      returned, having knocked out his pipe and even left his matches on a
      stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t waste time in asking questions,&rdquo; said Orme as the Professor
      approached with caution. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain. We are going on a queer journey
      to-night&mdash;four white men with about a dozen half-bred mongrel scamps
      of doubtful loyalty, so you see Quick and I thought it as well to have
      some of this stuff handy. Probably it will never be wanted, and if wanted
      we shall have no time to use it; still, who knows? There, that will do.
      Ten canisters; enough to blow up half the Fung if they will kindly sit on
      them. You take five, Quick, a battery and three hundred yards of wire, and
      I&rsquo;ll take five, a battery, and three hundred yards of wire. Your
      detonators are all fixed, aren&rsquo;t they? Well, so are mine,&rdquo; and without
      more words he proceeded to stow away his share of the apparatus in the
      poacher pockets of his coat and elsewhere, while Quick did likewise with
      what remained. Then the case that they had opened was fastened up again
      and removed to be laden on a camel.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW WE ESCAPED FROM HARMAC
    </h3>
    <p>
      As finally arranged this was the order of our march: First went an Abati
      guide who was said to be conversant with every inch of the way. Then came
      Orme and Sergeant Quick, conducting the camels that were loaded with the
      explosives. I followed in order to keep an eye upon these precious beasts
      and those in charge of them. Next marched some more camels, carrying our
      baggage, provisions, and sundries, and finally in the rear were the
      Professor and Shadrach with two Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach, I should explain, had selected this situation for the reason, as
      he said, that if he went first, after what had passed, any mistake or
      untoward occurrence might be set down to his malice, whereas, if he were
      behind, he could not be thus slandered. On hearing this, Higgs, who is a
      generous soul, insisted upon showing his confidence in the virtue of
      Shadrach by accompanying him as a rearguard. So violently did he insist,
      and so flattered did Shadrach seem to be by this mark of faith, that Orme,
      who, I should say, if I have not already done so, was in sole command of
      the party now that hostilities were in the air, consented to the plan, if
      with evident reluctance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I know, his own view was that it would be best for us four Englishmen
      to remain together, although, if we did so, whatever position we chose, it
      would be impossible for us in that darkness to keep touch with the line of
      camels and their loads, which were almost as important to us as our lives.
      At least, having made up our minds to deliver them in Mur, we thought that
      they were important, perhaps because it is the fashion of the Anglo-Saxon
      race to put even a self-created idea of duty before personal safety or
      convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rightly or wrongly, so things were settled, for in such troublous
      conditions one can only do what seems best at the moment. Criticism
      subsequent to the event is always easy, as many an unlucky commander has
      found out when the issue went awry, but in emergency one must decide on
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun set, the darkness fell, and it began to rain and blow. We started
      quite unobserved, so far as we could tell, and, travelling downward from
      the overgrown, ruined town, gained the old road, and in complete silence,
      for the feet of camels make no noise, passed along it toward the lights of
      Harmac, which now and again, when the storm-clouds lifted, we saw
      glimmering in front of us and somewhat to our left.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all my long wanderings I cannot remember a more exciting or a more
      disagreeable journey. The blackness, relieved only from time to time by
      distant lightnings, was that of the plagues of Egypt; the driving rain
      worked through the openings of our camel-hair cloaks and the waterproofs
      we wore underneath them, and wet us through. The cold, damp wind chilled
      us to the bone, enervated as we were with the heat of the desert. But
      these discomforts, and they were serious enough, we forgot in the
      tremendous issue of the enterprise. Should we win through to Mur? Or, as a
      crown to our many labours and sufferings, should we perish presently on
      the road? That was the question; as I can assure the reader, one that we
      found very urgent and interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours had gone by. Now we were opposite to the lights of Harmac,
      also to other lights that shone up a valley in the mountain to our right.
      As yet everything was well; for this we knew by the words whispered up and
      down the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden, in front of us a light flashed, although as yet it was a
      long way off. Next came another whispered message of &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; So we halted,
      and presently one of the front guides crept back, informing us that a body
      of Fung cavalry had appeared upon the road ahead. We took counsel.
      Shadrach arrived from the rear, and said that if we waited awhile they
      might go away, as he thought that their presence must be accidental and
      connected with the great festival. He implored us to be quite silent.
      Accordingly, not knowing what to do, we waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I think I have forgotten to say that the dog Pharaoh, to prevent
      accidents, occupied a big basket; this basket, in which he often rode when
      tired, being fixed upon one side of Orme&rsquo;s camel. Here he lay peaceably
      enough until, in an unlucky moment, Shadrach left me to go forward to talk
      to the Captain, whereon, smelling his enemy, Pharaoh burst out into
      furious baying. After that everything was confusion. Shadrach darted back
      toward the rear. The light ahead began to move quickly, advancing toward
      us. The front camels left the road, as I presume, following their leader
      according to the custom of these beasts when marching in line.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, I know not how, Orme, Quick, and myself found ourselves
      together in the darkness; at the time we thought Higgs was with us also,
      but in this we were mistaken. We heard shoutings and strange voices
      speaking a language that we could not understand. By the sudden glare of a
      flash of lightning, for the thunderstorm was now travelling over us, we
      saw several things. One of these was the Professor&rsquo;s riding-dromedary,
      which could not be mistaken because of its pure white colour and queer
      method of holding its head to one side, passing within ten yards, between
      us and the road, having a man upon its back who evidently was not the
      Professor. Then it was that we discovered his absence and feared the
      worst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Fung has got his camel,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Quick; &ldquo;Shadrach has got it. I saw his ugly mug against the
      light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Another vision was that of what appeared to be our baggage camels moving
      swiftly away from us, but off the road which was occupied by a body of
      horsemen in white robes. Orme issued a brief order to the effect that we
      were to follow the camels with which the Professor might be. We started to
      obey, but before we had covered twenty yards of the cornfield or whatever
      it was in which we were standing, heard voices ahead that were not those
      of Abati. Evidently the flash which showed the Fung to us had done them a
      like service, and they were now advancing to kill or capture us.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was only one thing to do&mdash;turn and fly&mdash;and this we did,
      heading whither we knew not, but managing to keep touch of each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a quarter of an hour later, just as we were entering a grove of
      palms or other trees which hid everything in front of us, the lightning
      blazed again, though much more faintly, for by this time the storm had
      passed over the Mountains of Mur, leaving heavy rain behind it. By the
      flash I, who was riding last and, as it chanced, looking back over my
      shoulder, saw that the Fung horsemen were not fifty yards behind, and
      hunting for us everywhere, their line being extended over a long front. I
      was, however, sure that they had not yet caught sight of us in the dense
      shadow of the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get on,&rdquo; I said to the others; &ldquo;they will be here presently,&rdquo; and heard
      Quick add:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give your camel his head, Captain; he can see in the dark, and perhaps
      will take us back to the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orme acted on this suggestion, which, as the blackness round us was
      pitchy, seemed a good one. At any rate it answered, for off we went at a
      fair pace, the three camels marching in line, first over soft ground and
      afterwards on a road. Presently I thought that the rain had stopped, since
      for a few seconds none fell on us, but concluded from the echo of the
      camels&rsquo; feet and its recommencement that we had passed under some archway.
      On we went, and at length even through the gloom and rain I saw objects
      that looked like houses, though if so there were no lights in them,
      perhaps because the night drew toward morning. A dreadful idea struck me:
      we might be in Harmac! I passed it up for what it was worth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; whispered Orme back. &ldquo;Perhaps these camels were bred here,
      and are looking for their stables. Well, there is only one thing to do&mdash;go
      on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we went on for a long while, only interfered with by the occasional
      attentions of some barking dog. Luckily of these Pharaoh, in his basket,
      took no heed, probably because it was his habit if another dog barked at
      him to pretend complete indifference until it came so near that he could
      spring and fight, or kill it. At length we appeared to pass under another
      archway, after which, a hundred and fifty yards or so further on, the
      camels came to a sudden stop. Quick dismounted, and presently I heard him
      say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doors. Can feel the brasswork on them. Tower above, I think, and wall on
      either side. Seem to be in a trap. Best stop here till light comes.
      Nothing else to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, we stopped, and, having tied the camels to each other to
      prevent their straying, took shelter from the rain under the tower or
      whatever it might be. To pass away the time and keep life in us, for we
      were almost frozen with the wet and cold, we ate some tinned food and
      biscuits that we carried in our saddle-bags, and drank a dram of brandy
      from Quick&rsquo;s flask. This warmed us a little, though I do not think that a
      bottleful would have raised our spirits. Higgs, whom we all loved, was
      gone, dead, probably, by that time; the Abati had lost or deserted us, and
      we three white men appeared to have wandered into a savage stronghold,
      where, as soon as we were seen, we should be trapped like birds in a net,
      and butchered at our captor&rsquo;s will. Certainly the position was not
      cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overwhelmed with physical and mental misery, I began to doze; Orme grew
      silent, and the Sergeant, having remarked that there was no need to
      bother, since what must be must be, consoled himself in a corner by
      humming over and over again the verse of the hymn which begins:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;There is a blessed home beyond this land of woe,
     Where trials never come nor tears of sorrow flow.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Fortunately for us, shortly before dawn the &ldquo;tears of sorrow&rdquo; as
      represented by the rain ceased to flow. The sky cleared, showing the
      stars; suddenly the vault of heaven was suffused with a wonderful and
      pearly light, although on the earth the mist remained so thick that we
      could see nothing. Then above this sea of mist rose the great ball of the
      sun, but still we could see nothing that was more than a few yards away
      from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a blessed home beyond this land of woe&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      droned Quick beneath his breath for about the fiftieth time, since,
      apparently, he knew no other hymn which he considered suitable to our
      circumstances, then ejaculated suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hullo! here&rsquo;s a stair. With your leave I&rsquo;ll go up it, Captain,&rdquo; and he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later we heard his voice calling us softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and see something worth looking at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we scrambled up the steps, and, as I rather expected, found ourselves
      upon the top of one of two towers set above an archway, which towers were
      part of a great protective work outside the southern gates of a city that
      could be none other than Harmac. Soaring above the mist rose the mighty
      cliffs of Mur that, almost exactly opposite to us, were pierced by a deep
      valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this valley the sunlight poured, revealing a wondrous and
      awe-inspiring object of which the base was surrounded by billowy vapours,
      a huge, couchant animal fashioned of black stone, with a head carved to
      the likeness of that of a lion, and crowned with the <i>uraeus</i>, the
      asp-crested symbol of majesty in old Egypt. How big the creature might be
      it was impossible to say at that distance, for we were quite a mile away
      from it; but it was evident that no other monolithic monument that we had
      ever seen or heard of could approach its colossal dimensions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared to this tremendous effigy indeed, the boasted Sphinx of Gizeh
      seemed but a toy. It was no less than a small mountain of rock shaped by
      the genius and patient labour of some departed race of men to the form of
      a lion-headed monster. Its majesty and awfulness set thus above the
      rolling mists in the red light of the morning, reflected on it from the
      towering precipices beyond, were literally indescribable; even in our
      miserable state, they oppressed and overcame us, so that for awhile we
      were silent. Then we spoke, each after his own manner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idol of the Fung!&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;No wonder that savages should take it for
      a god.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The greatest monolith in all the world,&rdquo; muttered Orme, &ldquo;and Higgs is
      dead. Oh! if only he had lived to see it, he would have gone happy. I wish
      it had been I who was taken; I wish it had been I!&rdquo; and he wrung his
      hands, for it is the nature of Oliver Orme always to think of others
      before himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we have come to blow up,&rdquo; soliloquized Quick. &ldquo;Well, those
      &lsquo;azure stinging-bees,&rsquo; or whatever they call the stuff (he meant
      azo-imides) are pretty active, but it will take a lot of stirring if ever
      we get there. Seems a pity, too, for the old pussy is handsome in his
      way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come down,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;We must find out where we are; perhaps we can
      escape in the mist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Do you see that?&rdquo; and I pointed to a
      needle-like rock that pierced the fog about a mile to the south of the
      idol valley, and say two miles from where we were. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the White Rock;
      it isn&rsquo;t white really, but the vultures roost on it and make it look so. I
      have never seen it before, for I passed it in the night, but I know that
      it marks the beginning of the cleft which runs up to Mur; you remember,
      Shadrach told us so. Well, if we can get to that White Rock we have a
      chance of life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orme studied it hurriedly and repeated, &ldquo;Come down; we may be seen up
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We descended and began our investigations in feverish haste. This was the
      sum of them: In the arch under the tower were set two great doors covered
      with plates of copper or bronze beaten into curious shapes to represent
      animals and men, and apparently very ancient. These huge doors had grilles
      in them through which their defenders could peep out or shoot arrows. What
      seemed more important to us, however, was that they lacked locks, being
      secured only by thick bronze bolts and bars such as we could undo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s clear out before the mist lifts,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;With luck we may get
      to the pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We assented, and I ran to the camels that lay resting just outside the
      arch. Before I reached them, however, Quick called me back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look through there, Doctor,&rdquo; he said, pointing to one of the peep-holes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did so, and in the dense mist saw a body of horsemen advancing toward
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must have seen us on the top of the wall. &ldquo;Fools that we were to go
      there!&rdquo; exclaimed Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next instant he started back, not a second too soon, for through the hole
      where his face had been, flashed a spear which struck the ground beyond
      the archway. Also we heard other spears rattle upon the bronze plates of
      the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No luck!&rdquo; said Orme; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all up, they mean to break in. Now I think
      we had better play a bold game. Got your rifles, Sergeant and Doctor? Yes?
      Then choose your loopholes, aim, and empty the magazines into them. Don&rsquo;t
      waste a shot. For heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t waste a shot. Now&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three,
      fire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fire we did into the dense mass of men who had dismounted and were running
      up to the doors to burst them open. At that distance we could scarcely
      miss and the magazines of the repeating rifles held five shots apiece. As
      the smoke cleared away I counted quite half-a-dozen Fung down, while some
      others were staggering off, wounded. Also several of the men and horses
      beyond were struck by the bullets which had passed through the bodies of
      the fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of this murderous discharge was instantaneous and remarkable.
      Brave though the Fung might be, they were quite unaccustomed to magazine
      rifles. Living as they did perfectly isolated and surrounded by a great
      river, even if they had heard of such things and occasionally seen an old
      gaspipe musket that reached them in the course of trade, of modern guns
      and their terrible power they knew nothing. Small blame to them,
      therefore, if their courage evaporated in face of a form of sudden death
      which to them must have been almost magical. At any rate they fled
      incontinently, leaving their dead and wounded on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now again we thought of flight, which perhaps would have proved our wisest
      course, but hesitated because we could not believe that the Fung had left
      the road clear, or done more than retreat a little to wait for us. While
      we lost time thus the mist thinned a great deal, so much indeed that we
      could see our exact position. In front of us, towards the city side, lay a
      wide open space, whereof the walls ended against those of Harmac itself,
      to which they formed a kind of vestibule or antechamber set there to
      protect this gateway of the town through which we had ridden in the
      darkness, not knowing whither we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those inner doors are open,&rdquo; said Orme, nodding his head toward the great
      portals upon the farther side of the square. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go see if we can shut
      them. Otherwise we shan&rsquo;t hold this place long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we ran across to the further doors that were similar to those through
      which we had just fired, only larger, and as we met nobody to interfere
      with our efforts, found that the united strength of the three of us was
      just, only just, sufficient to turn first one and then the other of them
      upon its hinges and work the various bolts and bars into their respective
      places. Two men could never have done the job, but being three and fairly
      desperate we managed it. Then we retreated to our archway and, as nothing
      happened, took the opportunity to eat and drink a few mouthfuls, Quick
      remarking sagely that we might as well die upon full as upon empty
      stomachs.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we had crossed the square the fog was thinning rapidly, but as the
      sun rose, sucking the vapours from the rain-soaked earth, it thickened
      again for awhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sergeant,&rdquo; said Orme presently, &ldquo;these black men are bound to attack us
      soon. Now is the time to lay a mine while they can&rsquo;t see what we are
      after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking the same thing, Captain; the sooner the better,&rdquo;
       replied Quick. &ldquo;Perhaps the Doctor will keep a watch here over the camels,
      and if he sees any one stick up his head above the wall, he might bid him
      good-morning. We know he is a nice shot, is the Doctor,&rdquo; and he tapped my
      rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      I nodded and the two of them set out laden with wires and the packages
      that looked like tobacco tins, heading for a stone erection in the centre
      of the square which resembled an altar, but was, I believe, a rostrum
      whence the native auctioneers sold slaves and other merchandise. What they
      did there exactly, I am sure I do not know; indeed, I was too much
      occupied in keeping a watch upon the walls whereof I could clearly see the
      crest above the mist, to pay much attention to their proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently my vigilance was rewarded, for over the great gateway opposite,
      at a distance of about a hundred and fifty paces from me, appeared some
      kind of a chieftain clad in white robes and wearing a very fine turban or
      coloured head-dress, who paraded up and down, waving a spear defiantly and
      uttering loud shouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man I covered very carefully, lying down to do so. As Quick had said,
      I am a good rifle shot, having practised that art for many years; still,
      one may always miss, which, although I bore no personal grudge against the
      poor fellow in the fine head-dress, on this occasion I did not wish to do.
      The sudden and mysterious death of that savage would, I felt sure, produce
      a great effect among his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he stopped exactly over the door and began to execute a kind of
      war-dance, turning his head from time to time to yell out something to
      others on the farther side of the wall. This was my opportunity. I covered
      him with as much care as though I were shooting at a target, with one
      bull&rsquo;s eye to win. Aiming a little low in case the rifle should throw
      high, very gently I pressed the trigger. The cartridge exploded, the
      bullet went on its way, and the man on the wall stopped dancing and
      shouting and stood quite still. Clearly he had heard the shot or felt the
      wind of the ball, but was untouched.
    </p>
    <p>
      I worked the lever jerking out the empty case, preparatory to firing
      again, but on looking up saw that there was no need, for the Fung captain
      was spinning round on his heels like a top. Three or four times he whirled
      thus with incredible rapidity, then suddenly threw his arms wide, and
      dived headlong from the wall like a bather from a plank, but backward, and
      was soon no more. Only from the farther side of those gates arose a wail
      of wrath and consternation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this no other Fung appeared upon the wall, so I turned my attention
      to the spy-hole in the doors behind me, and seeing some horsemen moving
      about at a distance of four or five hundred yards on a rocky ridge where
      the mist did not lie, I opened fire on them and at the second shot was
      fortunate enough to knock a man out of the saddle. One of those with him,
      who must have been a brave fellow, instantly jumped down, threw him, dead
      or living, over the horse, leaped up behind him, and galloped away
      accompanied by the others, pursued by some probably ineffective bullets
      that I sent after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the road to the Pass of Mur seemed to be clear, and I regretted that
      Orme and Quick were not with me to attempt escape. Indeed, I meditated
      fetching or calling them, when suddenly I saw them returning, burying a
      wire or wires in the sand as they came, and at the same time heard a noise
      of thunderous blows of which I could not mistake the meaning. Evidently
      the Fung were breaking down the farther bronze doors with some kind of
      battering-ram. I ran out to meet them and told my news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done,&rdquo; said Orme in a quiet voice. &ldquo;Now, Sergeant, just join up
      those wires to the battery, and be careful to screw them in tight. You
      have tested it, haven&rsquo;t you? Doctor, be good enough to unbar the gates.
      No, you can&rsquo;t do that alone; I&rsquo;ll help you presently. Look to the camels
      and tighten the girths. These Fung will have the doors down in a minute,
      and then there will be no time to lose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked as I obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Show them some fireworks, I hope. Bring the camels into the archway so
      that they can&rsquo;t foul the wire with their feet. So&mdash;stand still, you
      grumbling brutes! Now for these bolts. Heavens! how stiff they are. I
      wonder why the Fung don&rsquo;t grease them. One door will do&mdash;never mind
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Labouring furiously we got it undone and ajar. So far as we could see
      there was no one in sight beyond. Scared by our bullets or for other
      reasons of their own, the guard there appeared to have moved away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we take the risk and ride for it?&rdquo; I suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered Orme. &ldquo;If we do, even supposing there are no Fung waiting
      beyond the rise, those inside the town will soon catch us on their swift
      horses. We must scare them before we bolt, and then those that are left of
      them may let us alone. Now listen to me. When I give the word, you two
      take the camels outside and make them kneel about fifty yards away, not
      nearer, for I don&rsquo;t know the effective range of these new explosives; it
      may be greater than I think. I shall wait until the Fung are well over the
      mine and then fire it, after which I hope to join you. If I don&rsquo;t, ride as
      hard as you can go to that White Rock, and if you reach Mur give my
      compliments to the Child of Kings, or whatever she is called, and say that
      although I have been prevented from waiting upon her, Sergeant Quick
      understands as much about picrates as I do. Also get Shadrach tried and
      hanged if he is guilty of Higgs&rsquo;s death. Poor old Higgs! how he would have
      enjoyed this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beg your pardon, Captain,&rdquo; said Quick, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll stay with you. The
      doctor can see to the baggage animals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be good enough to obey orders and fall to the rear when you are
      told, Sergeant? Now, no words. It is necessary for the purposes of this
      expedition that one of us two should try to keep a whole skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; pleaded Quick, &ldquo;mayn&rsquo;t I take charge of the battery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered sternly. &ldquo;Ah! the doors are down at last,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to a horde of Fung, mounted and on foot, who poured through the
      gateway where they had stood, shouting after their fashion, and went on:
      &ldquo;Now then, pick out the captains and pepper away. I want to keep them back
      a bit, so that they come on in a crowd, not scattered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We took up our repeating rifles and did as Orme told us, and so dense was
      the mass of humanity opposite that if we missed one man, we hit another,
      killing or wounding a number of them. The result of the loss of several of
      their leaders, to say nothing of meaner folk, was just what Orme had
      foreseen. The Fung soldiers, instead of rushing on independently, spread
      to right and left, until the whole farther side of the square filled up
      with thousands of them, a veritable sea of men, at which we pelted bullets
      as boys hurl stones at a wave.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the pressure of those behind thrust onward those in front, and
      the whole fierce, tumultuous mob began to flow forward across the square,
      a multitude bent on the destruction of three white men, armed with these
      new and terrible weapons. It was a very strange and thrilling sight; never
      have I seen its like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Orme, &ldquo;stop firing and do as I bid you. Kneel the camels fifty
      yards outside the wall, not less, and wait till you know the end. If we
      shouldn&rsquo;t meet again, well, good-bye and good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we went, Quick literally weeping with shame and rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;good Lord! to think that, after four
      campaigns, Samuel Quick, Sergeant of Engineers, with five medals, should
      live to be sent off with the baggage like a pot-bellied bandmaster,
      leaving his captain to fight about three thousand niggers single-handed.
      Doctor, if he don&rsquo;t come out, you do the best you can for yourself, for
      I&rsquo;m going back to stop with him, that&rsquo;s all. There, that&rsquo;s fifty paces;
      down you go, you ugly beasts,&rdquo; and he bumped his camel viciously on the
      head with the butt of his rifle.
    </p>
    <p>
      From where we had halted we could only see through the archway into the
      space beyond. By now the square looked like a great Sunday meeting in Hyde
      Park, being filled up with men of whom the first rows were already past
      the altar-like rostrum in its centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he loose off them stinging-bees?&rdquo; muttered Quick. &ldquo;Oh! I see
      his little game. Look,&rdquo; and he pointed to the figure of Orme, who had
      crept behind the unopened half of the door on our side of it and was
      looking intently round its edge, holding the battery in his right hand.
      &ldquo;He wants to let them get nearer so as to make a bigger bag. He&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I heard no more of Quick&rsquo;s remarks, for suddenly something like an
      earthquake took place, and the whole sky seemed to turn to one great
      flame. I saw a length of the wall of the square rush outward and upward. I
      saw the shut half of the bronze-plated door skipping and hopping playfully
      toward us, and in front of it the figure of a man. Then it began to rain
      all sorts of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, stones, none of which hit us, luckily, and other more
      unpleasant objects. It is a strange experience to be knocked backward by a
      dead fist separated from its parent body, yet on this occasion this
      actually happened to me, and, what is more, the fist had a spear in it.
      The camels tried to rise and bolt, but they are phlegmatic brutes, and, as
      ours were tired as well, we succeeded in quieting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst we were thus occupied somewhat automatically, for the shock had
      dazed us, the figure that had been propelled before the dancing door
      arrived, reeling in a drunken fashion, and through the dust and falling <i>débris</i>
      we knew it for that of Oliver Orme. His face was blackened, his clothes
      were torn half off him, and blood from a scalp wound ran down his brown
      hair. But in his right hand he still held the little electric battery, and
      I knew at once that he had no limbs broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very successful mine,&rdquo; he said thickly. &ldquo;Boer melinite shells aren&rsquo;t in
      it with this new compound. Come on before the enemy recover from the
      shock,&rdquo; and he flung himself upon his camel.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another minute we had started at a trot toward the White Rock, whilst
      from the city of Harmac behind us rose a wail of fear and misery. We
      gained the top of the rise on which I had shot the horseman, and, as I
      expected, found that the Fung had posted a strong guard in the dip beyond,
      out of reach of our bullets, in order to cut us off, should we attempt to
      escape. Now, terrified by what had happened, to them a supernatural
      catastrophe, they were escaping themselves, for we perceived them
      galloping off to the left and right as fast as their horses would carry
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So for awhile we went on unmolested, though not very quickly, because of
      Orme&rsquo;s condition. When we had covered about half the distance between us
      and the White Rock, I looked round and became aware that we were being
      pursued by a body of cavalry about a hundred strong, which I supposed had
      emerged from some other gate of the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Flog the animals,&rdquo; I shouted to Quick, &ldquo;or they will catch us after all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did so, and we advanced at a shambling gallop, the horsemen gaining on
      us every moment. Now I thought that all was over, especially when of a
      sudden from behind the White Rock emerged a second squad of horsemen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cut off!&rdquo; I exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose so, sir,&rdquo; answered Quick, &ldquo;but these seem a different crowd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I scanned them and saw that he was right. They were a very different
      crowd, for in front of them floated the Abati banner, which I could not
      mistake, having studied it when I was a guest of the tribe: a curious,
      triangular, green flag covered with golden Hebrew characters, surrounding
      the figure of Solomon seated on a throne. Moreover, immediately behind the
      banner in the midst of a bodyguard rode a delicately shaped woman clothed
      in pure white. It was the Child of Kings herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      Two more minutes and we were among them. I halted my camel and looked
      round to see that the Fung cavalry were retreating. After the events of
      that morning clearly they had no stomach left for a fight with a superior
      force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady in white rode up to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greetings, friend,&rdquo; she exclaimed to me, for she knew me again at once.
      &ldquo;Now, who is captain among you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I pointed to the shattered Orme, who sat swaying on his camel with eyes
      half closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; she said, addressing him, &ldquo;if you can, tell me what has
      happened. I am Maqueda of the Abati, she who is named Child of Kings. Look
      at the symbol on my brow, and you will see that I speak truth,&rdquo; and,
      throwing back her veil, she revealed the coronet of gold that showed her
      rank.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BARUNG
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the sound of this soft voice (the extreme softness of Maqueda&rsquo;s voice
      was always one of her greatest charms), Orme opened his eyes and stared at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very queer dream,&rdquo; I heard him mutter. &ldquo;Must be something in the
      Mohammedan business after all. Extremely beautiful woman, and that gold
      thing looks well on her dark hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does the lord your companion say?&rdquo; asked Maqueda of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having first explained that he was suffering from shock, I translated word
      for word, whereon Maqueda blushed to her lovely violet eyes and let fall
      her veil in a great hurry. In the confusion which ensued, I heard Quick
      saying to his master:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, sir; this one ain&rsquo;t no houri. She&rsquo;s a flesh and blood queen, and
      the pleasantest to look at I ever clapped eyes on, though a benighted
      African Jew. Wake up, Captain, wake up; you are out of that hell-fire now.
      It&rsquo;s got the Fung, not you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word Fung seemed to rouse Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I understand. The vapour of the stuff poisoned me, but it
      is passing now. Adams, ask that lady how many men she&rsquo;s got with her. What
      does she say? About five hundred? Well, then, let her attack Harmac at
      once. The outer and inner gates are down; the Fung think they have raised
      the devil and will run. She can inflict a defeat on them from which they
      will not recover for years, only it must be done at once, before they get
      their nerve again, for, after all, they are more frightened than hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda listened to this advice intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to my liking; it is very good,&rdquo; she said in her quaint archaic
      Arabic when I had finished translating. &ldquo;But I must consult my Council.
      Where is my uncle, the prince Joshua?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Lady,&rdquo; answered a voice from the press behind, out of which
      presently emerged, mounted on a white horse, a stout man, well advanced in
      middle age, with a swarthy complexion and remarkably round, prominent
      eyes. He was clad in the usual Eastern robes, richly worked, over which he
      wore a shirt of chain-mail, and on his head a helmet, with mail flaps, an
      attire that gave the general effect of an obese Crusader of the early
      Norman period without his cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that Joshua?&rdquo; said Orme, who was wandering a little again.
      &ldquo;Rummy-looking cock, isn&rsquo;t he? Sergeant, tell Joshua that the walls of
      Jericho are down, so there&rsquo;ll be no need to blow his own trumpet. I&rsquo;m sure
      from the look of him that he&rsquo;s a perfect devil with a trumpet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does your companion say?&rdquo; asked Maqueda again.
    </p>
    <p>
      I translated the middle part of Orme&rsquo;s remarks, but neither the
      commencement nor the end, but even these amused her very much, for she
      burst out laughing, and said, pointing to Harmac, over which still hung a
      cloud of dust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, Joshua, my uncle, the walls of Jericho are down, and the
      question is, will you not take your opportunity? So in an hour or two we
      shall be dead, or if God goes with us, perhaps free from the menace of the
      Fung for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prince Joshua stared at her with his great, prominent eyes, then
      answered in a thick, gobbling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad, Child of Kings? Of us Abati here there are but five hundred
      men, and of the Fung yonder tens of thousands. If we attacked, they would
      eat us up. Can five hundred men stand against tens of thousands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems that three stood against them this morning, and worked some
      damage, my uncle, but it is true those three are of a different race from
      the Abati,&rdquo; she added with bitter sarcasm. Then she turned to those behind
      her and cried: &ldquo;Who of my captains and Council will accompany me, if I who
      am but a woman dare to advance on Harmac?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now here and there a voice cried, &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; or some gorgeously dressed
      person stepped forward in a hesitating way, and that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, men of the West!&rdquo; said Maqueda after a little pause, addressing
      us three. &ldquo;I thank you for the great deeds that you have done and for your
      counsel. But I cannot take it because my people are not&mdash;warlike,&rdquo;
       and she covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there arose a great tumult among her followers, who all began to talk
      at once. Joshua in particular drew a large sword and waved it, shouting
      out a recital of the desperate actions of his youth and the names of Fung
      chieftains whom he alleged he had killed in single combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Told you that fat cur was a first-class trumpeter,&rdquo; said Orme languidly,
      while the Sergeant ejaculated in tones of deep disgust:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! what a set. Why, Doctor, they ain&rsquo;t fit to savage a referee in
      a London football ground. Pharaoh there in his basket (where he was
      barking loudly) would make the whole lot run, and if he was out&mdash;oh
      my! Now, then, you porpoise&rdquo;&mdash;this he addressed to Joshua, who was
      flourishing his sword unpleasantly near&mdash;&ldquo;put your pasteboard up,
      won&rsquo;t you, or I&rsquo;ll knock your fat head off,&rdquo; whereon the Prince, who, if
      he did not understand Quick&rsquo;s words, at any rate caught their meaning
      wonderfully well, did as he was told, and fell back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then, indeed, there was a general movement up the pass, in the wide
      mouth of which all this scene took place, for suddenly three Fung
      chieftains appeared galloping toward us, one of whom was veiled with a
      napkin in which were cut eyeholes. So universal was this retreat, in fact,
      that we three on our camels, and the Child of Kings on her beautiful mare,
      found ourselves left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An embassy,&rdquo; said Maqueda, scanning the advancing horsemen, who carried
      with them a white flag tied to the blade of a spear. &ldquo;Physician, will you
      and your friends come with me and speak to these messengers?&rdquo; And without
      even waiting for an answer, she rode forward fifty yards or so on to the
      plain, and there reined up and halted till we could bring our camels round
      and join her. As we did so, the three Fung, splendid-looking, black-faced
      fellows, arrived at a furious gallop, their lances pointed at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stand still, friends,&rdquo; said Maqueda; &ldquo;they mean no harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the words passed her lips, the Fung pulled the horses to their
      haunches, Arab-fashion, lifted spears and saluted. Then their leader&mdash;not
      the veiled man, but another&mdash;spoke in a dialect that I, who had spent
      so many years among the savages of the desert, understood well enough,
      especially as the base of it was Arabic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O, Walda Nagasta, Daughter of Solomon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we are the tongues of
      our Sultan Barung, Son of Barung for a hundred generations, and we speak
      his words to the brave white men who are your guests. Thus says Barung.
      Like the Fat One whom I have already captured, you white men are heroes.
      Three of you alone, you held the gate against my army. With the weapons of
      the white man you killed us from afar, here one and there one. Then, at
      last, with a great magic of thunder and lightning and earthquake, you sent
      us by scores into the bosom of our god, and shook down our walls about our
      ears and out of that hell you escaped yourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, O white men, this is the offer of Barung to you: Leave the curs of
      the Abati, the baboons who gibber and deck themselves out, the
      rock-rabbits who seek safety in the cliffs, and come to him. He will give
      you not only life, but all your heart&rsquo;s desire&mdash;lands and wives and
      horses; great shall you be in his councils and happy shall you live.
      Moreover, for your sakes he will try to spare your brother, the Fat One,
      whose eyes look out of black windows, who blows fire from his mouth, and
      reviles his enemies as never man did before. Yes, although the priests
      have doomed him to sacrifice at the next feast of Harmac, he will try to
      spare him, which, perhaps, he can do by making him, like the Singer of
      Egypt, also a priest of Harmac, and thus dedicate forever to the god with
      whom, indeed, he says he had been familiar for thousands of years. This is
      our message, O white men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now, when I had translated the substance of this oration to Orme and
      Quick, for, as I saw by the quiver that passed through her at the Fung
      insults upon her tribe, Maqueda understood it, their tongues not differing
      greatly, Orme who, for the time at any rate, was almost himself again,
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell these fellows to say to their Sultan that he is a good old boy, and
      that we thank him very much; also that we are sorry to have been obliged
      to kill so many of them in a way that he must have thought
      unsportsmanlike, but we had to do it, as we are sure he will understand,
      in order to save our skins. Tell him also that, speaking personally,
      having sampled the Abati yonder and on our journey, I should like to
      accept his invitation. But although, as yet, we have found no men among
      them, only, as he says, baboons, rock-rabbits, and boasters without a
      fight in them, we have&rdquo;&mdash;and here he bowed his bleeding head to
      Maqueda&mdash;&ldquo;found a woman with a great heart. Of her salt we have
      eaten, or are about to eat; to serve her we have come from far upon her
      camels, and, unless she should be pleased to accompany us, we cannot
      desert her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All of this I rendered faithfully, while every one, and especially
      Maqueda, listened with much attention. When they had considered our words,
      the spokesman of the messengers replied to the effect that the motives of
      our decision were of a nature that commanded their entire respect and
      sympathy, especially as their people quite concurred in our estimate of
      the character of the Abati ruler, Child of Kings. This being so, they
      would amend their proposition, knowing the mind of their Sultan, and
      having, indeed, plenipotentiary powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady of Mur,&rdquo; he went on, addressing Maqueda directly, &ldquo;fair daughter of
      the great god Harmac and a mortal queen, what we have offered to the white
      lords, your guests, we offer to you also. Barung, our Sultan, shall make
      you his head wife; or, if that does not please you, you shall wed whom you
      will&rdquo;&mdash;and, perhaps by accident, the envoy&rsquo;s roving eyes rested for a
      moment upon Oliver Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leave, then, your rock-rabbits, who dare not quit their cliffs when but
      three messengers wait without with sticks,&rdquo; and he glanced at the spear in
      his hand, &ldquo;and come to dwell among men. Listen, high Lady; we know your
      case. You do your best in a hopeless task. Had it not been for you and
      your courage, Mur would have been ours three years ago, and it was ours
      before your tribe wandered thither. But while you can find but a hundred
      brave warriors to help you, you think the place impregnable, and you have
      perhaps that number, though we know they are not here; they guard the
      gates above. Yes, with a few of your Mountaineers whose hearts are as
      those of their forefathers were, so far as you have defied all the power
      of the Fung, and when you saw that the end drew near, using your woman&rsquo;s
      wit, you sent for the white men to come with their magic, promising to pay
      them with the gold which you have in such plenty in the tombs of our old
      kings and in the rocks of the mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you that, O Tongue of Barung?&rdquo; asked Maqueda in a low voice,
      speaking for the first time. &ldquo;The man of the West whom you took prisoner&mdash;he
      whom you call Fat One?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, O Walda Nagasta, the lord Black Windows has told us nothing as
      yet, except sundry things about the history of our god, with whom, as we
      said, he seems to be familiar, and to whom, therefore, we vowed him at
      once. But there are others who tell us things, for in times of truce our
      peoples trade together a little, and cowards are often spies. For
      instance, we knew that these white men were coming last night, though it
      is true that we did not know of their fire magic, for, had we done so, we
      should not have let the camels slip through, since there may be more of it
      on them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your comfort, learn that there is&mdash;much more,&rdquo; I interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied the Tongue, shaking his head sadly, &ldquo;and yet we suffered
      Cat, whom you call Shadrach, to make off with that of your fat brother;
      yes, and even gave it to him after his own beast had been lamed by
      accident. Well, it is our bad luck, and without doubt Harmac is angry with
      us to-day. But your answer, O Walda Nagasta, your answer, O Rose of Mur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can it be, O Voices of Barung the Sultan?&rdquo; replied Maqueda. &ldquo;You
      know that by my blood and by my oath of office I am sworn to protect Mur
      to the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you shall,&rdquo; pleaded the Tongue, &ldquo;for when we have cleaned it of
      baboons and rock-rabbits, which, if you were among us, we soon should do,
      and thus fulfilled our oath to regain our ancient secret City of the
      Rocks, we will set you there once more as its Lady, under Barung, and give
      you a multitude of subjects of whom you may be proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be, O Tongue, for they would be worshippers of Harmac, and
      between Jehovah, whom I serve, and Harmac there is war,&rdquo; she answered with
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sweet-smelling Bud of the Rose, there is war, and let it be admitted
      that the first battle has gone against Harmac, thanks to the magic of the
      white men. Yet yonder he sits in his glory as the spirits, his servants,
      fashioned him in the beginning,&rdquo; and he pointed with his spear toward the
      valley of the idol. &ldquo;You know our prophecy&mdash;that until Harmac rises
      from his seat and flies away, for where he goes, the Fung must follow&mdash;till
      then, I say, we shall hold the plains and the city of his name&mdash;that
      is, for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For ever is a long word, O Mouth of Barung.&rdquo; Then she paused a little,
      and added slowly, &ldquo;Did not certain of the gates of Harmac fly far this
      morning? Now what if your god should follow his gates and those
      worshippers who went with them, and be seen no more? Or what if the earth
      should open and swallow him, so that he goes down to hell, whither you
      cannot follow? Or what if the mountains should fall together and bury him
      from your sight eternally. Or what if the lightnings should leap out and
      shatter him to dust?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these ominous words the envoys shivered, and it seemed to me that their
      faces for a moment turned grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, O Child of Kings,&rdquo; answered the spokesman solemnly, &ldquo;the Fung will
      acknowledge that your god is greater than our god, and that our glory is
      departed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he spoke and was silent, turning his eyes toward the third messenger,
      he who wore a cloth or napkin upon his head that was pierced with eyeholes
      and hung down to the breast. With a quick motion, the man dragged off this
      veil and threw it to the ground, revealing a very noble countenance, not
      black like that of his followers, but copper-coloured. He was about fifty
      years of age, with deep-set flashing eyes, hooked nose, and a flowing,
      grizzled beard. The collar of gold about his neck showed that his rank was
      high, but when we noticed a second ornament of gold, also upon his brow,
      we knew that it must be supreme. For this ornament was nothing less than
      the symbol of royalty, once worn by the ancient Pharaohs of Egypt, the
      double snakes of the <i>uraeus</i> bending forward as though to strike,
      which, as we had seen, rose also from the brow of the lion-headed sphinx
      of Harmac.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he uncovered, his two companions leapt to the ground and prostrated
      themselves before him, crying, &ldquo;Barung! Barung!&rdquo; while all three of us
      Englishmen saluted, involuntarily, I think, and even the Child of Kings
      bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan acknowledged our greetings by raising his spear. Then he spoke
      in a grave measured voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Walda Nagasta, and you, white men, sons of great fathers, I have
      listened to the talk between you and my servants; I confirm their words
      and I add to them. I am sorry that my generals tried to kill you last
      night. I was making prayer to my god, or it should not have happened. I
      have been well repaid for that deed, since an army should not make war
      upon four men, even though by their secret power four men can defeat an
      army. I beseech you, and you also, Rose of Mur, to accept my proffered
      friendship, since otherwise, ere long, you will soon be dead, and your
      wisdom will perish with you for I am weary of this little war against a
      handful whom we despise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Walda Nagasta, you have breathed threats against the Majesty of Harmac,
      but he is too strong for you, nor may the might that can turn a few bricks
      to dust and shatter the bones of men prevail against him who is shaped
      from the heart of a mountain and holds the spirit of eternity. So at least
      I think: but even if it is decreed otherwise, what will that avail you? If
      it should please the god to leave us because of your arts, the Fung will
      still remain to avenge him ere they follow. Then I swear to you by my
      majesty and by the bones of my ancestors who sit in the caves of Mur, that
      I will spare but one of the Abati Jews, yourself, O Child of Kings,
      because of your great heart, and the three white men, your guests, should
      they survive the battle, because of their courage and their wisdom. As for
      their brother, Black Windows, whom I have captured, he must be sacrificed,
      since I have sworn it, unless you yield, when I will plead for his life to
      the god, with what result I cannot tell. Yield, then, and I will not even
      slay the Abati; they shall live on and serve the Fung as slaves and
      minister to the glory of Harmac.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may not be, it may not be!&rdquo; Maqueda answered, striking the pommel of
      her saddle with her small hand. &ldquo;Shall Jehovah whom Solomon, my father,
      worshipped, Jehovah of all the generations, do homage to an idol shaped by
      the hands He made? My people are worn out; they have forgot their faith
      and gone astray, as did Israel in the desert. I know it. It may even
      happen that the time has come for them to perish, who are no longer
      warriors, as of old. Well, if so, let them die free, and not as slaves. At
      least I, in whom their best blood runs, do not seek your mercy, O Barung.
      I&rsquo;ll be no plaything in your house, who, at the worst, can always die,
      having done my duty to my God and those who bred me. Thus I answer you as
      the Child of many Kings. Yet as a woman,&rdquo; she added in a gentler voice, &ldquo;I
      thank you for your courtesy. When I am slain, Barung, if I am fated to be
      slain, think kindly of me, as one who did her best against mighty odds,&rdquo;
       and her voice broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I shall always do,&rdquo; he answered gravely. &ldquo;Is it ended?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;These Western lords, I give them to you; I
      absolve them from their promise. Why should they perish in a lost cause?
      If they take their wisdom to you to use against me, you have vowed them
      their lives, and, perhaps, that of their brother, your captive. There is a
      slave of yours also&mdash;you spoke of him, or your servant did&mdash;Singer
      of Egypt is his name. One of them knew him as a child; perchance you will
      not refuse him to that man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused, but Barung made no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go, my friends,&rdquo; she went on, turning toward us. &ldquo;I thank you for your
      long journey on my behalf and the blow you have struck for me, and in
      payment I will send you a gift of gold; the Sultan will see it safe into
      your hands. I thank you. I wish I could have known more of you, but mayhap
      we shall meet again in war. Farewell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ceased, and I could see that she was watching us intently through her
      thin veil. The Sultan also watched us, stroking his long beard, a look of
      speculation in his eyes, for evidently this play interested him and he
      wondered how it would end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Orme, when he understood the thing. &ldquo;Higgs would
      never forgive us if we ate dirt just on the off-chance of saving him from
      sacrifice. He&rsquo;s too straight-minded on big things. But, of course,
      Doctor,&rdquo; he added jerkily, &ldquo;you have interests of your own and must decide
      for yourself. I think I can speak for the Sergeant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have decided,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;I hope that my son would never forgive me
      either; but if it is otherwise, why, so it must be. Also Barung has made
      no promises about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, then,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;My head aches infernally, and I want to go
      to bed, above ground or under it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I told him, although, to speak the truth, I felt like a man with a
      knife in his heart, for it was bitter to come so near to the desire of
      years, to the love of life, and then to lose all hope just because of duty
      to the head woman of a pack of effete curs to whom one had chanced to make
      a promise in order to gain this very end. If we could have surrendered
      with honour, at least I should have seen my son, whom now I might never
      see again.
    </p>
    <p>
      One thing, however, I added on the spur of the moment&mdash;namely, a
      request that the Sultan would tell the Professor every word that had
      passed, in order that whatever happened to him he might know the exact
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Harmac,&rdquo; said Barung when he had heard, &ldquo;how disappointed should I
      have been with you if you had answered otherwise when a woman showed you
      the way. I have heard of you English before&mdash;Arabs and traders
      brought me tales of you. For instance, there was one who died defending a
      city against a worshipper of the Prophet who called himself a prophet,
      down yonder at Khartoum on the Nile&mdash;a great death, they told me, a
      great death, which your people avenged afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I did not quite believe the story, and I wished to judge of it by
      you. I have judged, white lords, I have judged, and I am sure that your
      fat brother, Black Windows, will be proud of you even in the lion&rsquo;s jaws.
      Fear not; he shall hear every word. The Singer of Egypt, who, it appears,
      can talk his tongue, shall tell the tale to him, and make a song of it to
      be sung over your honourable graves. And now farewell; may it be my lot to
      cross swords with one of you before all is done. That shall not be yet,
      for you need rest, especially yonder tall son of a god who is wounded,&rdquo;
       and he pointed to Orme. &ldquo;Child of Kings with a heart of kings, permit me
      to kiss your hand and to lead you back to your people, that I would were
      more worthy of you. Ah! yes, I would that <i>we</i> were your people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda stretched out her hand, and, taking it, the Sultan barely touched
      her fingers with his lips. Then, still holding them, he rode with her
      toward the pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we approached its mouth, where the Abati were crowded together,
      watching our conference, I heard them murmur, &ldquo;The Sultan, the Sultan
      himself!&rdquo; and saw the prince Joshua mutter some eager words to the
      officers about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, Doctor,&rdquo; said Quick into my ear. &ldquo;Unless I&rsquo;m mistook, that
      porpoise is going to play some game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hardly were the words out of his mouth when, uttering the most valiant
      shouts and with swords drawn, Joshua and a body of his companions galloped
      up and surrounded our little group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now yield, Barung,&rdquo; bellowed Joshua; &ldquo;yield or die!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Sultan stared at him in astonishment, then answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had any weapon (he had thrown down his lance when he took Maqueda by
      the hand), certainly one of us should die, O Hog in man&rsquo;s clothes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Maqueda and added, &ldquo;Child of Kings, I knew these people
      of yours to be cowardly and treacherous, but is it thus that you suffer
      them to deal with envoys under a flag of peace?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so, not so,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My uncle Joshua, you disgrace me; you make
      our people a shame, a hissing, and a reproach. Stand back; let the Sultan
      of the Fung go free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they would not; the prize was too great to be readily disgorged.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked at each other. &ldquo;Not at all the game,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;If they collar
      him, we shall be tarred with their extremely dirty brush. Shove your camel
      in front, Sergeant, and if that beggar Joshua tries any tricks, put a
      bullet through him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick did not need to be told twice. Banging his dromedary&rsquo;s ribs with the
      butt end of his rifle, he drove it straight on to Joshua, shouting:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the light, porpoise!&rdquo; with the result that the Prince&rsquo;s horse took
      fright, and reared up so high that its rider slid off over its tail to
      find himself seated on the ground, a sorry spectacle in his gorgeous robes
      and armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of the confusion which ensued, we surrounded the Sultan
      and escorted him out of the throng back to his two companions, who, seeing
      that there was something amiss, were galloping toward us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am your debtor,&rdquo; said Barung, &ldquo;but, O White Men, make me more so.
      Return, I pray you, to that hog in armour, and say that Barung, Sultan of
      the Fung, understands from his conduct that he desires to challenge him to
      single combat, and that, seeing he is fully armed, the Sultan, although he
      wears no mail, awaits him here and now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I went at once with the message. But Joshua was far too clever to be
      drawn into any such dangerous adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing, he said, would have given him greater joy than to hack the head
      from the shoulders of this dog of a Gentile sheik. But, unhappily, owing
      to the conduct of one of us foreigners, he had been thrown from his horse,
      and hurt his back, so that he could scarcely stand, much less fight a
      duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I returned with my answer, whereat Barung smiled and said nothing.
      Only, taking from his neck a gold chain which he wore, he proffered it to
      Quick, who, as he said, had induced the prince Joshua to show his
      horsemanship if not his courage. Then he bowed to us, one by one, and
      before the Abati could make up their mind whether to follow him or not,
      galloped off swiftly with his companions toward Harmac.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was our introduction to Barung, Sultan of the Fung, a barbarian with
      many good points, among them courage, generosity, and appreciation of
      those qualities even in a foe, characteristics that may have been
      intensified by the blood of his mother, who, I am told, was an Arab of
      high lineage captured by the Fung in war and given as a wife to the father
      of Barung.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SHADOW OF FATE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our ride from the plains up the pass that led to the high tableland of Mur
      was long and, in its way, wonderful enough. I doubt whether in the whole
      world there exists another home of men more marvellously defended by
      nature. Apparently the road by which we climbed was cut in the first
      instance, not by human hands, but by the action of primæval floods,
      pouring, perhaps, from the huge lake which doubtless once covered the
      whole area within the circle of the mountains, although to-day it is but a
      moderate-sized sheet of water, about twenty miles long by ten in breadth.
      However this may be, the old inhabitants had worked on it, the marks of
      their tools may still be seen upon the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first mile or two the road is broad and the ascent so gentle that
      my horse was able to gallop up it on that dreadful night when, after
      seeing my son&rsquo;s face, accident, or rather Providence, enabled me to escape
      the Fung. But from the spot where the lions pulled the poor beast down,
      its character changes. In places it is so narrow that travellers must
      advance in single file between walls of rock hundreds of feet high, where
      the sky above looks like a blue ribbon, and even at midday the path below
      is plunged in gloom. At other spots the slope is so precipitous that
      beasts of burden can scarcely keep their foothold; indeed, we were soon
      obliged to transfer ourselves from the camels to horses accustomed to the
      rocks. At others, again, it follows the brink of a yawning precipice, an
      ugly place to ride or turn rectangular corners, which half-a-dozen men
      could hold against an army, and twice it passes through tunnels, though
      whether these are natural I do not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides all these obstacles to an invader there were strong gates at
      intervals, with towers near by where guards were stationed night and day,
      and fosses or dry moats in front of them which could only be crossed by
      means of drawbridges. So the reader will easily understand how it came
      about that, whatever the cowardice of the Abati, though they strove for
      generations, the Fung had as yet never been able to recapture the ancient
      stronghold, which, or so it is said, in the beginning these Abati won from
      them by means of an Oriental trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I should add that, although there are two other roads to the plains&mdash;that
      by which, in order to outflank the Fung, the camels were let down when I
      started on my embassy to Egypt, and that to the north where the great
      swamps lie&mdash;these are both of them equally, if not more, impassable,
      at any rate to an enemy attacking from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strange cavalcade we must have seemed as we crawled up this terrific
      approach. First went a body of the Abati notables on horseback, forming a
      long line of colour and glittering steel, who chattered as they rode, for
      they seemed to have no idea of discipline. Next came a company of horsemen
      armed with spears, or rather two companies in the centre of which rode the
      Child of Kings, some of her courtiers and chief officers, and ourselves,
      perhaps, as Quick suggested, because infantry in the event of surprise
      would find it less easy to run away than those who were mounted upon
      horses. Last of all rode more cavalry, the duty of whose rear files it was
      to turn from time to time, and, after inspection, to shout out that we
      were not pursued.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be said that we who occupied the centre of the advance were a
      cheerful band. Orme, although so far he had borne up, was evidently very
      ill from the shock of the explosion, so much so that men had to be set on
      each side of him to see that he did not fall from the saddle. Also he was
      deeply depressed by the fact that honour had forced us to abandon Higgs to
      what seemed a certain and probably a cruel death; and if he felt thus,
      what was my own case, who left not only my friend, but also my son, in the
      hands of savage heathens?
    </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda&rsquo;s face was not visible because of the thin spangled veil that she
      wore, but there was something about her attitude suggestive of shame and
      of despair. The droop of the head and even her back showed this, as I, who
      rode a little behind and on side of her, could see. I think, too, that she
      was anxious about Orme, for she turned toward him several times as though
      studying his condition. Also I am sure that she was indignant with Joshua
      and others of her officers, for when they spoke to her she would not
      answer or take the slightest notice of them beyond straightening herself
      in the saddle. As for the Prince himself, his temper seemed to be much
      ruffled, although apparently he had overcome the hurt to his back which
      prevented him from accepting the Sultan&rsquo;s challenge, for at a difficult
      spot in the road he dismounted and ran along actively enough. At any rate,
      when his subordinates addressed him he only answered them with muttered
      oaths, and his attitude towards us Englishmen, especially Quick, was not
      amiable. Indeed, if looks could have killed us I am sure that we should
      all have been dead before ever we reached the Gate of Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      This so-called gate was the upper mouth of the pass whence first we saw,
      lying beneath us, the vast, mountain-ringed plain beyond. It was a
      beautiful sight in the sunshine. Almost at our feet, half-hidden in palms
      and other trees, lay the flat-roofed town itself, a place of considerable
      extent, as every house of any consequence seemed to be set in a garden,
      since here there was no need for cramping walls and defensive works.
      Beyond it to the northward, farther than the eye could reach, stretching
      down a gentle slope to the far-off shores of the great lake of glistening
      water, were cultivated fields, and amongst them villas and, here and
      there, hamlets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever might be the faults of the Abati, evidently they were skilled
      husbandsmen, such as their reputed forefathers, the old inhabitants of
      Judæa, must have been before them, for of that strain presumably some
      trace was still present in their veins. However far he may have drifted
      from such pursuits, originally the Jew was a tiller of the soil, and here,
      where many of his other characteristics had evaporated under pressure of
      circumstances&mdash;notably the fierce courage that Titus knew&mdash;this
      taste remained to him, if only by tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, having no other outlet for their energies and none with whom to
      trade, the interests of the Abati were centred in the land. For and by the
      land they lived and died, and, since the amount available was limited by
      the mountain wall, he who had most land was great amongst them, he who had
      little land was small, he who had no land was practically a slave. Their
      law was in its essentials a law of the land; their ambitions, their
      crimes, everything to do with them, were concerned with the land, upon the
      produce of which they existed and grew rich, some of them, by means of a
      system of barter. They had no coinage, their money being measures of corn
      or other produce, horses, camels, acres of their equivalent of soil, and
      so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, oddly enough, their country is the richest in gold and other
      metals that I have ever heard of even in Africa&mdash;so rich that,
      according to Higgs, the old Egyptians drew bullion from it to the value of
      millions of pounds every year. This, indeed, I can well believe, for I
      have seen the ancient mines which were worked, for the most part as open
      quarries, still showing plenty of visible gold on the face of the slopes.
      Yet to these alleged Jews this gold was of no account. Imagine it; as
      Quick said, such a topsy-turvy state of things was enough to make a mere
      Christian feel cold down the back and go to bed thinking that the world
      must be coming to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return, the prince Joshua, who appeared to be generalissimo of the
      army, in what was evidently a set phrase, exhorted the guards at the last
      gates to be brave and, if need were, deal with the heathen as some one or
      other dealt with Og, King of Bashan, and other unlucky persons of a
      different faith. In reply he received their earnest congratulations upon
      his escape from the frightful dangers of our journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      These formalities concluded, casting off the iron discipline of war, we
      descended a joyous mob, or rather the Abati did, to partake of the
      delights of peace. Really, conquerors returning from some desperate
      adventure could not have been more warmly greeted. As we entered the
      suburbs of the town, women, some of them very handsome, ran out and
      embraced their lords or lovers, holding up babies for them to kiss, and a
      little farther on children appeared, throwing roses and pomegranate
      flowers before their triumphant feet. And all this because these gallant
      men had ridden to the bottom of a pass and back again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens! Doctor,&rdquo; exclaimed the sardonic Quick, after taking note of
      these demonstrations, &ldquo;Heavens! what a hero I feel myself to be. And to
      think that when I got back from the war with them Boers, after being left
      for dead on Spion Kop with a bullet through my lung and mentioned in a
      dispatch&mdash;yes, I, Sergeant Quick, mentioned in a dispatch by the
      biggest ass of a general as ever I clapped eyes on, for a job that I won&rsquo;t
      detail, no one in my native village ever took no note of me, although I
      had written to the parish clerk, who happens to be my brother-in-law, and
      told him the train I was coming by. I tell you, Doctor, no one so much as
      stood me a pint of beer, let alone wine,&rdquo; and he pointed to a lady who was
      proffering that beverage to some one whom she admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as for chucking their arms round my neck and kissing me,&rdquo; and he
      indicated another episode, &ldquo;all my old mother said&mdash;she was alive
      then&mdash;was that she &lsquo;hoped I&rsquo;d done fooling about furrin&rsquo; parts as I
      called soldiering, and come home to live respectable, better late than
      never.&rsquo; Well, Doctor, circumstances alter cases, or blood and climate do,
      which is the same thing, and I didn&rsquo;t miss what I never expected, why
      should I when others like the Captain there, who had done so much more,
      fared worse? But, Lord! these Abati are a sickening lot, and I wish we
      were clear of them. Old Barung&rsquo;s the boy for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Passing down the main street of this charming town of Mur, accompanied by
      these joyous demonstrators, we came at last to its central square, a
      large, open space where, in the moist and genial climate, for the high
      surrounding mountains attracted plentiful showers of rain, trees and
      flowers grew luxuriantly. At the head of this square stood a long, low
      building with white-washed walls and gilded domes, backed by the towering
      cliff, but at a little distance from it, and surrounded by double walls
      with a moat of water between them, dug for purposes of defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the palace, which on my previous visit I had only entered once or
      twice when I was received by the Child of Kings in formal audience. Round
      the rest of this square, each placed in its own garden, were the houses of
      the great nobles and officials, and at its western end, among other public
      buildings, a synagogue or temple which looked like a model of that built
      by Solomon in Jerusalem, from the description of which it had indeed been
      copied, though, of course, upon a small scale.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the gate of the palace we halted, and Joshua, riding up, asked Maqueda
      sulkily whether he should conduct &ldquo;the Gentiles,&rdquo; for that was his polite
      description of us, to the lodging for pilgrims in the western town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, my uncle,&rdquo; answered Maqueda; &ldquo;these foreign lords will be housed in
      the guest-wing of the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the guest-wing of the palace? It is not usual,&rdquo; gobbled Joshua,
      swelling himself out like a great turkey cock. &ldquo;Remember, O niece, that
      you are still unmarried. I do not yet dwell in the palace to protect you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I found out in the plain yonder,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;still, I managed to
      protect myself. Now, I pray you, no words. I think it necessary that these
      my guests should be where their goods already are, in the safest place in
      Mur. You, my uncle, as you told us, are badly hurt, by which accident you
      were prevented from accepting the challenge of the Sultan of the Fung. Go,
      then, and rest; I will send the court physician to you at once.
      Good-night, my uncle; when you are recovered we will meet again, for we
      have much that we must discuss. Nay, nay, you are most kind, but I will
      not detain you another minute. Seek your bed, my uncle, and forget not to
      thank God for your escape from many perils.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this polite mockery Joshua turned perfectly pale with rage, like the
      turkey cock when his wattles fade from scarlet into white. Before he could
      make any answer, however, Maqueda had vanished under the archway, so his
      only resource was to curse us, and especially Quick, who had caused him to
      fall from his horse. Unfortunately the Sergeant understood quite enough
      Arabic to be aware of the tenor of his remarks, which he resented and
      returned:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut it, Porpoise,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and keep your eyes where Nature put &lsquo;em, or
      they&rsquo;ll fall out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What says the Gentile?&rdquo; spluttered Joshua, whereon Orme, waking up from
      one of his fits of lethargy, replied in Arabic:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says that he prays you, O Prince of princes, to close your noble mouth
      and to keep your high-bred eyes within their sockets lest you should lose
      them&rdquo;; at which words those who were listening broke into a fit of
      laughter, for one redeeming characteristic among the Abati was that they
      had a sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this I do not quite know what happened for Orme showed signs of
      fainting, and I had to attend to him. When I looked round again the gates
      were shut and we were being conducted toward the guest-wing of the palace
      by a number of gaily dressed attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took us to our rooms&mdash;cool, lofty chambers ornamented with
      glazed tiles of quaint colour and beautiful design, and furnished somewhat
      scantily with articles made of rich-hued woods. This guest-wing of the
      palace, where these rooms were situated, formed, we noted, a separate
      house, having its own gateway, but, so far as we could see, no passage or
      other connection joining it to the main building. In front of it was a
      small garden, and at its back a courtyard with buildings, in which we were
      informed our camels had been stabled. At the time we noted no more, for
      night was falling, and, even if it had not been, we were too worn out to
      make researches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Orme was now desperately ill&mdash;so ill that he could scarcely
      walk leaning even on our shoulders. Still, he would not be satisfied till
      he was sure that our stores were safe, and, before he could be persuaded
      to lie down, insisted upon being supported to a vault with copper-bound
      doors, which the officers opened, revealing the packages that had been
      taken from the camels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Count them, Sergeant,&rdquo; he said, and Quick obeyed by the light of a lamp
      that the officer held at the open door. &ldquo;All correct, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so
      far as I can make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, Sergeant. Lock the door and take the keys.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again he obeyed, and, when the officer demurred to their surrender, turned
      on him so fiercely that the man thought better of it and departed with a
      shrug of his shoulders, as I supposed to make report to his superiors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at length we got Orme to bed, and, as he complained of intolerable
      pains in his head and would take nothing but some milk and water, having
      first ascertained that he had no serious physical injuries that I could
      discover, I administered to him a strong sleeping-draught from my little
      travelling medicine case. To our great relief this took effect upon him in
      about twenty minutes, causing him to sink into a stupor from which he did
      not awake for many hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick and I washed ourselves, ate some food that was brought to us, and
      then took turns to watch Orme throughout the night. When I was at my post
      about six o&rsquo;clock on the following morning he woke up and asked for drink,
      which I gave to him. After swallowing it he began to wander in his mind,
      and, on taking his temperature, I found that he had over five degrees of
      fever. The end of it was that he went off to sleep again, only waking up
      from time to time and asking for more drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Twice during the night and early morning Maqueda sent to inquire as to his
      condition, and, apparently not satisfied with the replies, about ten in
      the forenoon arrived herself, accompanied by two waiting-ladies and a
      long-bearded old gentleman who, I understood, was the court physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I see him?&rdquo; she asked anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I answered yes, if she and those with her were quite quiet. Then I led
      them into the darkened room where Quick stood like a statue at the head of
      the bed, only acknowledging her presence with a silent salute. She gazed
      at Oliver&rsquo;s flushed face and the forehead blackened where the gases from
      the explosion had struck him, and as she gazed I saw her beautiful violet
      eyes fill with tears. Then abruptly she turned and left the sick-chamber.
      Outside its doors she waved back her attendants imperiously and asked me
      in a whisper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will he live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; I answered, for I thought it best that she should learn
      the truth. &ldquo;If he is only suffering from shock, fatigue, and fever, I
      think so, but if the explosion or the blow on his head where it cut has
      fractured the skull, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save him,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;I will give you all I&mdash;nay, pardon me;
      what need is there to tempt you, his friend, with reward? Only save him,
      save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will do what I can, Lady, but the issue is in other hands than mine,&rdquo; I
      answered, and just then her attendants came up and put an end to the
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this day the memory of that old rabbi, the court physician, affects me
      like a nightmare, for of all the medical fools that ever I met he was by
      far the most pre-eminent. All about the place he followed me suggesting
      remedies that would have been absurd even in the Middle Ages. The least
      harmful of them, I remember, was that poor Orme&rsquo;s head should be plastered
      with a compound of butter and the bones of a still-born child, and that he
      should be given some filthy compound to drink which had been specially
      blessed by the priests. Others there were also that would certainly have
      killed him in half-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, I got rid of him at last for the time, and returned to my vigil. It
      was melancholy work, since no skill that I had could tell me whether my
      patient would live or die. Nowadays the young men might know, or say that
      they did, but it must be remembered that, as a doctor, I am entirely
      superannuated. How could it be otherwise, seeing that I have passed the
      best of my life in the desert without any opportunity of keeping up with
      the times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days went by in this fashion, and very anxious days they were. For
      my part, although I said nothing of it to any one, I believed that there
      was some injury to the patient&rsquo;s skull and that he would die, or at best
      be paralyzed. Quick, however, had a different opinion. He said that he had
      seen two men in this state before from the concussion caused by the
      bursting of large shells near to them, and that they both recovered
      although one of them became an idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was Maqueda who first gave me any definite hope. On the third
      evening she came and sat by Orme for awhile, her attendants standing at a
      little distance. When she left him there was a new look upon her face&mdash;a
      very joyful look&mdash;which caused me to ask her what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! he will live,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      I inquired what made her think so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; she replied, blushing. &ldquo;Suddenly he looked up and in my own tongue
      asked me of what colour were my eyes. I answered that it depended upon the
      light in which they might be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;They are always <i>vi-o-let</i>, whether the
      curtain is drawn or no.&rsquo; Now, physician Adams, tell me what is this colour
      <i>vi-o-let</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That of a little wild flower which grows in the West in the spring, O
      Maqueda&mdash;a very beautiful and sweet-scented flower which is dark blue
      like your eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, Physician,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Well, I do not know this flower, but what
      of that? Your friend will live and be sane. A dying man does not trouble
      about the colour of a lady&rsquo;s eyes, and one who is mad does not give that
      colour right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you glad, O Child of Kings?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;seeing that I am told that this captain alone
      can handle the firestuffs which you have brought with you, and, therefore,
      that it is necessary to me that he should not die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Let us pray that we may keep him alive. But
      there are many kinds of firestuffs, O Maqueda, and of one of them which
      chances to give out violet flames I am not sure that my friend is master.
      Yet in this country it may be the most dangerous of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now when she heard these words the Child of Kings looked me up and down
      angrily. Then suddenly she laughed a little in a kind of silent way that
      is peculiar to her, and, without saying anything, beckoned to her ladies
      and left the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very variegated thing, woman, sir,&rdquo; remarked Quick, who was watching. (I
      think he meant to say &ldquo;variable.&rdquo;) &ldquo;This one, for instance, comes up that
      passage like a tired horse&mdash;shuffle, shuffle, shuffle&mdash;for I
      could hear the heels of her slippers on the floor. But now she goes out
      like a buck seeking its mate&mdash;head in air and hoof lifted. How do you
      explain it, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better ask the lady herself, Quick. Did the Captain take that
      soup she brought him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every drop, sir, and tried to kiss her hand afterward, being still dazed,
      poor man, poor man! I saw him do it, knowing no better. He&rsquo;ll be sorry
      enough when he comes to himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt, Sergeant. But meanwhile let us be glad that both their spirits
      seem to have improved, and if she brings any more soup when I am not
      there, I should let him have it. It is always well to humour invalids and
      women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Doctor; but,&rdquo; he added, with a sudden fall of face, &ldquo;invalids
      recover sometimes, and then how about the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;you had better
      go out for exercise; it is my watch.&rdquo; But to myself I thought that Fate
      was already throwing its ominous shadow before, and that it lay deep in
      Maqueda&rsquo;s violet eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, to cut a long story short, this was the turning-point of Orme&rsquo;s
      illness, and from that day he recovered rapidly, for, as it proved, there
      was no secret injury to the skull, and he was suffering from nothing
      except shock and fever. During his convalescence the Child of Kings came
      to see him several times, or to be accurate, if my memory serves me right,
      every afternoon. Of course, her visits were those of ceremony&mdash;that
      is to say, she was always accompanied by several of her ladies, that thorn
      in my flesh, the old doctor, and one or two secretaries and
      officers-in-waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as Oliver was now moved by day into a huge reception room, and these
      people of the court were expected to stop at one end of it while she
      conversed with him at the other, to all intents and purposes, save for the
      presence of myself and Quick, her calls were of a private nature. Nor were
      we always present, since, now that my patient was out of danger the
      Sergeant and I went out riding a good deal&mdash;investigating Mur and its
      surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be asked what they talked about on these occasions. I can only
      answer that, so far as I heard, the general subject was the politics of
      Mur and its perpetual war with the Fung. Still, there must have been other
      topics which I did not hear, since incidently I discovered that Orme was
      acquainted with many of Maqueda&rsquo;s private affairs whereof he could only
      have learned from her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus when I ventured to remark that perhaps it was not altogether wise for
      a young man in his position to become so intimate with the hereditary
      ruler of an exclusive tribe like the Abati, he replied cheerfully that
      this did not in the least matter, as, of course, according to their
      ancient laws, she could only marry with one of her own family, a fact
      which made all complications impossible. I inquired which of her cousins,
      of whom I knew she had several, was the happy man. He replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None of them. As a matter of fact, I believe that she is officially
      affianced to that fat uncle of hers, the fellow who blows his own trumpet
      so much, but I needn&rsquo;t add that this is only a form to which she submits
      in order to keep the others off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I wonder if Prince Joshua thinks it only a form?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know what he thinks, and don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; he replied, yawning; &ldquo;I only
      know that things stand as I say, and that the porpoise-man has as much
      chance of becoming the husband of Maqueda as you have of marrying the
      Empress of China. And now, to drop this matrimonial conversation and come
      to something more important, have you heard anything about Higgs and your
      son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are more in the way of learning state secrets than I am, Orme,&rdquo; I
      answered sarcastically, being rather irritated at the course of events and
      his foolishness. &ldquo;What have you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, old fellow. I can&rsquo;t say how she knows it, but Maqueda says that
      they are both in good health and well treated. Only our friend Barung
      sticks to his word and proposes to sacrifice poor old Higgs on this day
      fortnight. Now, of course, that must be prevented somehow, and prevented
      it shall be if it costs me my life. Don&rsquo;t you suppose that I have been
      thinking about myself all the time, for it isn&rsquo;t so, only the trouble is
      that I can&rsquo;t find any plan of rescue which will hold water.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s to be done, Orme? I haven&rsquo;t spoken much of the matter before
      for fear of upsetting you when you were still weak, but now that you are
      all right again we must come to some decision.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; he answered earnestly; &ldquo;and I tell you this, that rather
      than let Higgs die alone there, I will give myself up to Barung, and, if I
      can&rsquo;t save him, suffer with him, or for him if I can. Listen: there is to
      be a great council held by the Child of Kings on the day after to-morrow
      which we must attend, for it has only been postponed until I was well
      enough. At this council that rogue Shadrach is to be put upon his trial,
      and will, I believe, be condemned to death. Also we are formally to return
      Sheba&rsquo;s ring which Maqueda lent to you to be used in proof of her story.
      Well, we may learn something then, or at any rate must make up our minds
      to definite action. And now I am to have my first ride, am I not? Come on,
      Pharaoh,&rdquo; he added to the dog, which had stuck at his bedside all through
      his illness so closely that it was difficult to entice him away even to
      eat; &ldquo;we are going for a ride, Pharaoh; do you hear that, you faithful
      beast?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE SWEARING OF THE OATH
    </h3>
    <p>
      Two or three days after this conversation, I forget exactly which it was,
      Maqueda held her council in the great hall of the palace. When we entered
      the place in charge of a guard, as though we were prisoners, we found some
      hundreds of Abati gathered there who were seated in orderly rows upon
      benches. At the farther end, in an apse-shaped space, sat the Child of
      Kings herself on a gilded or perhaps a golden chair of which the arms
      terminated in lions&rsquo; heads. She was dressed in a robe of glittering
      silver, and wore a ceremonial veil embroidered with stars, also of silver,
      and above it, set upon her dark hair, a little circlet of gold, in which
      shone a single gem that looked like a ruby. Thus attired, although her
      stature is small, her appearance was very dignified and beautiful,
      especially as the gossamer veil added mystery to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the throne stood soldiers armed with spears and swords, and at its
      sides and in front of it were gathered her court to the number of a
      hundred or more, including her waiting-ladies, who in two companies were
      arranged to the right and left. Each member of this court was gorgeously
      dressed according to his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the generals and captains with Prince Joshua at the head of
      them in their Norman-like chain armour. There were judges in black robes
      and priests in gorgeous garments; there were territorial lords, of whose
      attire I remember only that they wore high boots, and men who were called
      Market-masters, whose business it was to regulate the rate of exchange of
      products, and with them the representatives of other trades.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, here was collected all the aristocracy of the little population
      of the town and territory of Mur, every one of whom, as we found
      afterwards, possessed some high-sounding title answering to those of our
      dukes and lords and Right Honourables, and knights, to say nothing of the
      Princes of the Blood, of whom Joshua was the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Really, although it looked so fine and gay, the spectacle was, in a sense,
      piteous, being evidently but a poor mockery and survival of the pageantry
      of a people that had once been great. The vast hall in which they were
      assembled showed this, since, although the occasion was one that excited
      public interest, it was after all but a quarter filled by those who had a
      right to be present.
    </p>
    <p>
      With much dignity and to the sound of music we were marched up the broad
      nave, if I may describe it thus, for the building, with its apse and
      supporting cedar columns, bore some resemblance to a cathedral, till we
      reached the open space in front of the throne, where our guards prostrated
      themselves in their Eastern fashion, and we saluted its occupant in our
      own. Then, chairs having been given to us, after a pause a trumpet blew,
      and from a side chamber was produced our late guide, Shadrach, heavily
      manacled and looking extremely frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial that followed I need not describe at length. It took a long
      while, and the three of us were called upon to give evidence as to the
      quarrel between our companion, the Professor, and the prisoner about the
      dog Pharaoh and other matters. The testimony, however, that proclaimed the
      guilt of Shadrach was that of his companion guides, who, it appeared, had
      been threatened with floggings unless they told the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      These men swore, one after the other, that the abandonment of Higgs had
      been a preconceived plan. Several of them added that Shadrach was in
      traitorous communication with the Fung, whom he had warned of our advent
      by firing the reeds, and had even contrived to arrange that we were to be
      taken while he and the other Abati, with the camels laden with our rifles
      and goods which they hoped to steal, passed through in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      In defence Shadrach boldly denied the whole story, and especially that he
      had pushed the Gentile, Higgs, off his dromedary, as was alleged, and
      mounted it himself because his own beast had broken down or been injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, his lies availed him little, since, after consultation with the
      Child of Kings, presently one of the black-robed judges condemned him to
      suffer death in a very cruel fashion which was reserved for traitors.
      Further, his possessions were to be forfeited to the State, and his wife
      and children and household to become public slaves, which meant that the
      males would be condemned to serve as soldiers, and the females allotted to
      certain officials in the order of their rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several of those who had conspired with him to betray us to the Fung were
      also deprived of their possessions and condemned to the army, which was
      their form of penal servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus amidst a mighty wailing of those concerned and of their friends and
      relatives ended this remarkable trial, of which I give some account
      because it throws light upon the social conditions of Abati. What hope is
      there for a people when its criminals are sent, not to jail, but to serve
      as soldiers, and their womenfolk however innocent, are doomed to become
      the slaves of the judges or whoever these may appoint. Be it added,
      however, that in this instance Shadrach and his friends deserved all they
      got, since, even allowing for a certain amount of false evidence,
      undoubtedly, for the purposes of robbery and private hate, they did betray
      those whom their ruler had sent them to guide and protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this trial was finished and Shadrach had been removed, howling for
      mercy and attempting to kiss our feet like the cur he was, the audience
      who had collected to hear it and to see us, the Gentile strangers,
      dispersed, and the members of the Privy Council, if I may call it so, were
      summoned by name to attend to their duties. When all had gathered, we
      three were requested to advance and take seats which had been placed for
      us among the councillors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a pause, and, as I had been instructed that I should do, I
      advanced and laid Sheba&rsquo;s ring upon a cushion held by one of the court
      officers, who carried it to Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child of Kings,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;take back this ancient token which you lent to
      me to be a proof of your good faith and mine. Know that by means of it I
      persuaded our brother who is captive, a man learned in all that has to do
      with the past, to undertake this mission, and through him the Captain Orme
      who stands before you, and his servant, the soldier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took it and, after examination, showed it to several of the priests,
      by whom it was identified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Though I parted from it with fear and doubt, the holy ring has served its
      purpose well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I thank you, Physician, for returning it to
      my people and to me in safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she replaced it on the finger from which it had been withdrawn when
      she gave it to me many months before.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, then, that matter ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now an officer cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walda Nagasta speaks!&rdquo; whereon every one repeated, &ldquo;Walda Nagasta
      speaks,&rdquo; and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Maqueda began to address us in her soft and pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strangers from the Western country called England,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;be pleased
      to hear me. You know our case with the Fung&mdash;that they surround us
      and would destroy us. You know that in our extremity I took advantage of
      the wandering hither of one of you a year ago to beg him to go to his own
      land and there obtain firestuffs and those who understand them, with which
      to destroy the great and ancient idol of the Fung. For that people declare
      that if this idol is destroyed they will leave the land they dwell in for
      another, such being their ancient prophecy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon, O Child of Kings,&rdquo; interrupted Orme, &ldquo;but you will remember that
      only the other day Barung, Sultan of the Fung, said that in this event his
      nation would still live on to avenge their god, Harmac. Also he said that
      of all the Abati he would leave you alive alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now at these ill-omened words a shiver and a murmur went through the
      Council. But Maqueda only shrugged her shoulders, causing the silver
      trimmings on her dress to tinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you the ancient prophecy,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;and for the rest
      words are not deeds. If the foul fiend, Harmac, goes I think that the Fung
      will follow him. Otherwise, why do they make sacrifice to Earthquake as
      the evil god they have to fear? And when some five centuries ago, such an
      earthquake shook down part of the secret city in the bowels of the
      mountains that I will show to you afterwards, why did they fly from Mur
      and take up their abode in the plain, as they said, to protect the god?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered Oliver. &ldquo;If our brother were here, he whom the
      Fung have captured, he might know, being learned in the ways of
      idol-worshipping, savage peoples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! O Son of Orme,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thanks to that traitor whom but now we
      have condemned, he is not here and, perhaps, could tell us nothing if he
      were. At least, the saying runs as I have spoken it, and for many
      generations, because of it, we Abati have desired to destroy the idol of
      the Fung to which so many of us have been offered in sacrifice through the
      jaws of their sacred lions. Now I ask,&rdquo; and she leaned forward, looking at
      Oliver, &ldquo;will you do this for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak of the reward, my niece,&rdquo; broke in Joshua in his thick voice when
      he saw that we hesitated what to answer, &ldquo;I have heard that these Western
      Gentiles are a very greedy people, who live and die for the gold which we
      despise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him, Captain,&rdquo; exclaimed Quick, &ldquo;if they despise land also, since
      yesterday afternoon I saw one of them try to cut the throat of another
      over a piece not bigger than a large dog-kennel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I added, for I confess that Joshua&rsquo;s remarks nettled me, &ldquo;and ask
      him whether the Jews did not despoil the Egyptians of their ornaments of
      gold in the old days, and whether Solomon, whom he claims as a forefather,
      did not trade in gold to Ophir, and lastly whether he knows that most of
      his kindred in other lands make a very god of gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Orme, as our spokesman, put these questions with great gusto to Joshua,
      whom he disliked intensely, whereat some of the Council, those who were
      not of the party of the Prince, smiled or even laughed, and the silvery
      ornaments upon Maqueda&rsquo;s dress began to shake again as though she also
      were laughing behind her veil. Still, she did not seem to think it wise to
      allow Joshua to answer&mdash;if he could&mdash;but did so herself, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, O my friends, that here we set small store by gold because,
      being shut in and unable to trade, it is of no use to us save as an
      ornament. Were it otherwise, doubtless we should value it as much as the
      rest of the world, Jew or Gentile, and shall do so when we are freed from
      our foes who hem us in. Therefore, my uncle is wrong to claim as a virtue
      that which is only a necessity, especially when, as your servant says,&rdquo;
       and she pointed to the Sergeant, &ldquo;our people make land their gold and will
      spend their lives in gaining more of it, even when they have enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do the Gentiles seek no reward for their services?&rdquo; sneered Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By no means, Prince,&rdquo; answered Oliver, &ldquo;we are soldiers of fortune, since
      otherwise why should we have come here to fight your quarrel&rdquo; (laying an
      unpleasant emphasis on the &ldquo;your&rdquo;) &ldquo;against a chief who, if half savage,
      to us seems to have some merits, those of honour and courage, for
      instance? If we risk our lives and do our work, we are not too proud to
      take whatever we can earn. Why should we be, seeing that some of us need
      wealth, and that our brother, who is as good as dead yonder, owing to the
      treachery of those who were sent to guard him, has relatives in England
      who are poor and should be compensated for his loss?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, indeed?&rdquo; ejaculated Maqueda. &ldquo;Listen, now, my friends. In my own
      name and in that of the Abati people I promised to you as many camel-loads
      of this gold as you can carry away from Mur, and before the day is done I
      will show it to you if you dare follow me to where it lies hid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First the work, then the pay,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;Now tell us, Child of Kings,
      what is that work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, O Son of Orme. You must swear&mdash;if this is not against your
      consciences as Christians&mdash;that for the space of one year from to-day
      you will serve me and fight for me and be subject to my laws, striving all
      the while to destroy the idol Harmac by your Western skill and weapons,
      after which you shall be free to go whither you will with your reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if we swear, Lady,&rdquo; asked Oliver after reflection, &ldquo;tell us what rank
      shall we hold in your service?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall be my chief captain for this enterprise, O Son of Orme, and
      those with you shall serve under you in such positions as you may please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words a murmur of dissatisfaction arose from the mail-clad
      generals in the Council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we then, to obey this stranger, O Child of Kings?&rdquo; queried Joshua as
      their spokesman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aye, my uncle, so far as this great enterprise is concerned, as I have
      said. Can you handle the firestuffs of which they alone have the secret?
      Could any three of you have held the gate of Harmac against the armies of
      the Fung and sent it flying skyward?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She paused and waited in the midst of a sullen silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not answer because you cannot,&rdquo; continued Maqueda. &ldquo;Then for this
      purpose be content to serve awhile under the command of those who have the
      skill and power which you lack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; said Orme in this ominous quiet, &ldquo;you are so good as to make me a
      general among your soldiers, but will they obey me? And who are your
      soldiers? Does every man of the Abati bear arms?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! no,&rdquo; she replied, fixing upon this latter question perhaps because
      she could not answer the first. &ldquo;Alas! no. In the old days it was
      otherwise, when my great ancestresses ruled, and then we did not fear the
      Fung. But now the people will not serve as soldiers. They say it takes
      them from their trades and the games they love; they say they cannot give
      the time in youth; they say that it degrades a man to obey the orders of
      those set over him; they say that war is barbarous and should be
      abolished, and all the while the brave Fung wait without to massacre our
      men and make our women slaves. Only the very poor and the desperate, and
      those who have offended against the laws will serve in my army, except it
      be as officers. Oh! and therefore are the Abati doomed,&rdquo; and, throwing
      back her veil, suddenly, she burst into tears before us all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know that I ever remember seeing a sight more pathetic in its way
      than that of this beautiful and high-spirited young woman weeping in the
      presence of her Council over the utter degeneracy of the race she was
      called upon to rule. Being old and accustomed to these Eastern expressions
      of emotion, I remained silent, however; but Oliver was so deeply affected
      that I feared lest he should do something foolish. He went red, he went
      white, and was rising from his seat to go to her, had I not caught him by
      the arm and pulled him back. As for Quick, he turned his eyes to the
      ceiling, as though engaged in prayer, and I heard him muttering:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Lord help the poor thing, the Lord help her; the one pearl in the
      snout of all these gilded swine! Well, I understand I am a bit of a
      general now, and if I don&rsquo;t make &lsquo;em sit up for her sake my name ain&rsquo;t
      Samuel Quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was much consternation and indignant murmuring amongst the
      Court, which felt that reflections had been thrown upon it collectively
      and individually. At such a crisis, as usual, Prince Joshua took the lead.
      Rising from his seat, he knelt, not without difficulty, before the throne,
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Child of Kings, why do you distress us with such words? Have you not
      the God of Solomon to protect you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God protects those who protect themselves,&rdquo; sobbed Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you not many brave officers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are officers without an army?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you not me, your uncle, your affianced, your lover?&rdquo; and he laid
      his hand where he conceived his heart to be, and stared up at her with his
      rolling, fish-like eyes. &ldquo;Had it not been for the interference of these
      Gentiles, in whom you seem to put such trust,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;should I not
      have taken Barung captive the other day, and left the Fung without a
      head?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the Abati without such shreds of honour as still belong to them, my
      uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us be wed, O Bud of the Rose, O Flower of Mur, and soon I will free
      you from the Fung. We are helpless because we are separate, but together
      we shall triumph. Say, O Maqueda, when shall we be wed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the idol Harmac is utterly destroyed, and the Fung have departed for
      ever, my uncle,&rdquo; she answered impatiently. &ldquo;But is this a time to talk of
      marriage? I declare the Council closed. Let the priests bring the rolls
      that these strangers from the West may take the oath, and then pardon me
      if I leave you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now from behind the throne there appeared a gorgeous gentleman arrayed in
      a head-dress that reminded me faintly of a bishop&rsquo;s mitre, and wearing
      over his robes a breastplate of precious stones roughly polished, which
      was half hidden by a very long white beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      This person, who it seemed was the high priest, carried in his hand a
      double roll of parchment written over with characters which we afterwards
      discovered were bastard Hebrew, very ancient and only decipherable by
      three or four of the Abati, if indeed any of them could really read it. At
      least it was said to be the roll of the law brought by their forefathers
      centuries ago from Abyssinia, together with Sheba&rsquo;s ring and a few other
      relics, among them the cradle (a palpable forgery), in which the child of
      Solomon and Maqueda, or Belchis, the first known Queen of Sheba, was
      traditionally reported to have been rocked. This roll of the law, which
      for generations had been used at all important ceremonies among the Abati,
      such as the swearing-in of their queens and chief officers, was now
      tendered to us to hold and kiss while we took the oath of obedience and
      allegiance in the names of Jehovah and of Solomon (a strange mixture, it
      struck us), solemnly vowing to perform those things which I have already
      set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This seems a pretty wide promise,&rdquo; said Oliver, after it had been read to
      us and translated by me to Quick. &ldquo;Do you think that we ought to take it
      on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; that was from my point of view, since otherwise I saw no
      chance of achieving the object that had caused me to enter upon this
      adventure. Then, being especially requested to do so, the Sergeant, after
      reflecting awhile, gave his considered opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said to Orme, &ldquo;we are three white men here consorting with a mob
      of quarter-bred African Jews and one real lady. It seems to me that we had
      best swear anything they want us to, trusting to the lady to see us
      through the mess, since otherwise we shall be mere filibusters in the
      country without official rank, and liable therefore to be shot on sight by
      the enemy, or any mutineers who get the upper hand here. Also, we have the
      Professor and the Doctor&rsquo;s son to think of. Therefore I say: Swear to
      anything in reason, reserving allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain,
      and trust to luck. You see, Captain, we are in their power anyway, and
      this oath may help, but can&rsquo;t hurt us, while to refuse it must give
      offence to all these skunks, and perhaps to the lady also, which is of
      more consequence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are probably right, Sergeant,&rdquo; said Orme. &ldquo;Anyway, in for a
      penny, in for a pound.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to Maqueda, who had been watching this conference in an
      unknown tongue with some anxiety, or so it seemed to me, and added in
      Arabic: &ldquo;O Child of Kings, we will take your oath, although it is wide,
      trusting to your honour to protect us from any pitfalls which it may
      cover, for we would ask you to remember that we are strangers in your land
      who do not understand its laws and customs. Only we stipulate that we
      retain our allegiance to our own ruler far away, remaining the subjects of
      that monarch with all rights thereto appertaining. Also, we stipulate that
      before we enter on our duties, or at any rate during those duties, we
      shall be at full liberty to attempt the rescue of our friend and
      companion, now a prisoner in the hands of the Fung, and of the son of one
      of us who is believed to be a slave to them, and that we shall have all
      the assistance which you can give us in this matter. Moreover, we demand
      that if we should be tried for any offence under this oath, you to whom we
      swear allegiance shall be our judge alone, none others intermeddling in
      the trial. If you accept these terms we will swear the oath; otherwise we
      swear nothing, but will act as occasion may arise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now we were requested to stand back while the Child of Kings consulted
      with her advisers, which she did for a considerable time, since evidently
      the questions raised involved differences of opinion. In the end, however,
      she and those who supported her seemed to overrule the objectors, and we
      were called up and told that our terms had been accepted and engrossed
      upon the form of the oath, and that everything there included would be
      faithfully observed by the Ruler and Council of the Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we signed and swore, kissing the book, or rather the roll, in the
      civilized fashion. Afterwards, very tired, for all this business had been
      anxious, we were conducted back to our own quarters to lunch, or rather to
      dine, for the Abati ate their heaviest meal at midday, taking a siesta
      after it according to the common Eastern custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      About four o&rsquo;clock of that afternoon I was awakened from my nap by the
      growls of Pharaoh, and looked up to see a man crouching against the door,
      evidently in fear of the dog&rsquo;s fangs. He proved to be a messenger from
      Maqueda, sent to ask us if we cared to accompany her to a place that we
      had never seen. Of course we answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and were at once led by the
      messenger to a disused and dusty hall at the back of the palace, where
      presently Maqueda and three of her ladies joined us, and with them a
      number of men who carried lighted lamps, gourds of oil, and bundles of
      torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless, friends,&rdquo; said Maqueda, who was unveiled and appeared to have
      quite recovered from our outburst of the morning, &ldquo;you have seen many
      wonderful places in this Africa and other lands, but now I am about to
      show you one that, I think, is stranger than them all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Following her, we came to a door at the end of the hall which the men
      unbolted and shut again behind us, and thence passed into a long passage
      cut in the rock, that sloped continuously downwards and at length led
      through another doorway to the vastest cave that we had ever heard of or
      seen. So vast was it, indeed, that the feeble light of our lamps did not
      suffice to reach the roof, and only dimly showed to right and left the
      outlines of what appeared to be shattered buildings of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Behold the cave city of Mur,&rdquo; said Maqueda, waving the lamp she held.
      &ldquo;Here it was that the ancients whom we believe to have been the
      forefathers of the Fung, had their secret stronghold. These walls were
      those of their granaries, temples, and places of ceremonial, but, as I
      have told you, centuries ago an earthquake shattered them, leaving them as
      they are now. Also, it broke down much of the cave itself, causing the
      roof to fall, so that there are many parts where it is not safe to enter.
      Come now and see what is left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We followed her into the depth of the wonderful place, our lanterns and
      torches making little stars of light in that great blackness. We saw the
      ruins of granaries still filled with the dust of what I suppose had once
      been corn, and came at length to a huge, roofless building of which the
      area was strewn with shattered columns, and among them overgrown statues,
      covered so thick by dust that we could only discover that most of them
      seemed to be shaped like sphinxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only Higgs were here,&rdquo; said Oliver with a sigh, and passed on to
      Maqueda, who was calling him to look at something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the temple in which it was unsafe to walk, she led us to where a
      strong spring, the water supply of the place, bubbled up into a rock
      basin, and overflowing thence through prepared openings, ran away we knew
      not whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look, this fountain is very ancient,&rdquo; said Maqueda, pointing to the lip
      of the basin that was worn away to the depth of several inches where those
      who drew water had for many generations rested their hands upon the hard
      rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did they light so vast a cavern?&rdquo; asked Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;since lamps would scarcely have served
      them. It is a secret of the past which none of the Abati have cared to
      recover, and another is how the air is always kept fresh so deep in the
      bowels of the mountain. We cannot even say whether this place is natural,
      as I think, or hollowed out by men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Both, I expect,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But tell me, Lady, do the Abati make any
      use of this great cave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some corn is still stored here in pits in case of siege,&rdquo; she replied,
      adding sadly, &ldquo;but it is not enough to be of real service, since almost
      all of it comes from the estates of the Child of Kings. In vain have I
      prayed the people to contribute, if only a hundredth part of their
      harvest, but they will not. Each says that he would give if his neighbour
      gave, and so none give. And yet a day may come when a store of corn alone
      would stand between them and death by hunger&mdash;if the Fung held the
      valley, for instance,&rdquo; and she turned impatiently and walked forward to
      show us the stables where the ancients kept their horses and the marks of
      their chariot wheels in the stone floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nice people, the Abati, sir,&rdquo; said Quick to me. &ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for the
      women and children, and, above all, for this little lady, whom I am
      beginning to worship like my master, as in duty bound, I&rsquo;d like to see
      them do a bit of hungering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one more place to show you,&rdquo; said Maqueda, when we had inspected
      the stables and argued as to what possible causes could have induced the
      ancients to keep horses underground, &ldquo;which perhaps you will think worth a
      visit, since it holds the treasures that are, or shall be, yours. Come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We started forward again along various passages, the last of which
      suddenly widened into a broad and steep incline of rock, which we followed
      for quite fifty paces till it ended in what seemed to be a blank wall.
      Here Maqueda bade her ladies and attendants halt, which indeed they seemed
      very anxious to do, though at the moment we did not know why. Then she
      went to one end of the wall where it joined that of the passage, and,
      showing us some loose stones, asked me to pull them out, which I did, not
      without difficulty. When an aperture had been made large enough for a man
      to creep through, she turned to her people and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, I know, believe this place to be haunted, nor would the bravest of
      you enter it save by express command. But I and these strangers have no
      such fears. Therefore give us a gourd of oil and some torches and bide
      where you are till we return, setting a lamp in the hole in the wall to
      guide us in case our own should become extinguished. No, do not reason but
      obey. There is no danger, for though hot, the air within is pure, as I
      know who have breathed it more than once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she gave her hand to Oliver, and with his assistance crept through
      the hole. We followed, to find ourselves in another cavern, where, as she
      had said, the temperature was much hotter than that without.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this place?&rdquo; asked Orme in a low voice, for its aspect seemed to
      awe him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The tomb of the old kings of Mur,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Presently you shall
      see,&rdquo; and once more she took his hand, for the slope was sharp and
      slippery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On we went, always descending, for perhaps four hundred yards, our
      footfalls echoing loudly in the intense silence, and our lamps, round
      which the bats circled in hundreds, making four stars of light in the
      utter blackness, till at length the passage widened out into what appeared
      to be a vast circular arena, with a lofty dome-like roof of rock. Maqueda
      turned to the right, and, halting before some objects that glimmered
      whitely, held up her light, saying, &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was what we saw: A great stone chair and, piled upon its seat and
      upon its base, human bones. Amongst these was a skull, and on it,
      grotesquely tilted, a crown of gold, while other ornaments&mdash;sceptres,
      rings, necklaces, weapons and armour&mdash;were mingled with the bones.
      Nor was this all, for in a wide circle round the chair were other
      skeletons, fifty or more of them, and amongst them the ornaments that
      their owners had worn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, in front of each stood a tray of some metal, which we afterwards
      discovered to be silver or copper, and heaped upon it every kind of
      valuable, such as golden cups and vases, toilet utensils, necklaces,
      pectorals, bracelets, leglets, earrings and beads that seemed to be cut
      from precious stones, piles of ring money, and a hundred other things such
      as have been prized by mankind since the beginning of civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You understand,&rdquo; said Maqueda, as we stared, open-mouthed at this awful
      and marvellous sight, &ldquo;he in the chair was the king. Those about him were
      his officers, guards, and women. When he was buried they brought his
      household here, bearing his wealth, sat them down about him, and killed
      them. Blow away the dust, and you will see that the rock beneath is still
      stained with their blood; also, there are the sword-marks on their skulls,
      and neckbones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quick, who was of an inquiring mind, stepped forward and verified these
      statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; he said, throwing down the skull of a man over whom the tired
      executioners had evidently bungled badly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t serve the old
      kings of Mur. But the same game goes on in a small way to-day in Africa,
      for when I was campaigning on the West Coast I came across it not a
      fortnight old, only there they had buried the poor beggars living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said Maqueda, when the Sergeant&rsquo;s remarks had been translated
      to her. &ldquo;Yet I do not think the custom is one that my people would love,&rdquo;
       and she laughed a little, then added, &ldquo;forward, friends, there are many
      more of these kings and oil does not burn for ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we moved on, and at a distance of some twenty paces found another chair
      with scattered bones on and about the seat, lying where each had fallen as
      the dead man decayed. Round it were the skeletons of the unfortunates who
      had been doomed to accompany him upon his last journey, every one of them
      behind his tray of golden objects, or of simple treasure. In front of this
      king&rsquo;s chair also were the bones of a dog with a jewelled collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again we proceeded to a third mortuary, if it may so be called, and here
      Maqueda pointed out the skeleton of a man, in front of which stood a tray
      piled up with what evidently had been the medicine bottles of the period
      and among them a number of rude surgical instruments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, O Physician Adams,&rdquo; she remarked with a smile, &ldquo;would you have
      wished to be court doctor to the kings of Mur, if indeed that was then
      their city&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Lady,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but I do wish to examine his instruments if I
      have your leave,&rdquo; and while she hurried forward I stooped down and filled
      my pockets. Here I may remark, that upon subsequent inspection I found
      among these instruments, manufactured I know not what number of thousands
      of years ago&mdash;for on that point controversy rages among the learned&mdash;many
      that with modifications are still in use to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of that strange and dreadful sepulchre there is little more to tell. From
      monarch to monarch we marched on till at length we grew weary of staring
      at bones and gold. Even Quick grew weary, who had passed his early youth
      in assisting his father, the parish sexton, and therefore, like myself,
      regarded these relics with professional interest, though of a different
      degree. At any rate, he remarked that this family vault was uncommonly
      hot, and perhaps, if it pleased her Majesty, as he called Maqueda, we
      might take the rest of the deceased gentlemen as read, like a recruit&rsquo;s
      attestation questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But just then we came to No. 25, according to my counting, and were
      obliged to stop to wonder, for clearly this king had been the greatest of
      them all, since round him lay about two or three times the average number
      of dead, and an enormous quantity of wealth, some of it in the form of
      little statues of men and women, or perhaps of gods. Yet, oddly enough, he
      was hunchback with a huge skull, almost a monstrosity indeed. Perhaps his
      mind partook of the abnormal qualities of his body, since no less than
      eleven little children had been sacrificed at his obsequies, two of whom,
      judging from their crooked bones, must have been his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      One wonders what chanced in Mur and the surrounding territories which then
      acknowledged its sway when King Hunchback ruled. Alas! history writes no
      record.

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      QUICK LIGHTS A MATCH
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here we begin to turn, for this cave is a great circle,&rdquo; said Maqueda
      over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Oliver, whom she addressed, had left her side and was engaged in
      taking observations behind the hunchback&rsquo;s funeral chair with an
      instrument which he had produced from his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed him and asked curiously what this thing might be, and why he
      made use of it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call it a compass,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and it tells me that beyond us lies
      the east, where the sun rises; also it shows at what height we stand above
      the sea, that great water which you have never seen, O Child of Kings. Say
      now, if we could walk through this rock, what should we find out yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The lion-headed idol of the Fung, I have been told,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;That
      which you saw before you blew up the gate of the city Harmac. But how far
      off it may be I do not know, for I cannot see through stone. Friend Adams,
      help me to refill the lamps, for they burn low, and all these dead would
      be ill company in the dark. So at least my people think, since there is
      not one of them that dares to enter this place. When first we found it
      only a few years ago and saw the company it held, they fled, and left me
      to search it alone. Look, yonder are my footsteps in the dust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So I refilled the shallow hand-lamps, and while I did so Orme took some
      hasty observations of which he jotted down the results in his pocket-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you learned?&rdquo; she asked, when at last he rejoined us somewhat
      unwillingly, for she had been calling to him to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so much as I should have done if you could have given me more time,&rdquo;
       he replied, adding in explanation, &ldquo;Lady, I was brought up as an engineer,
      that is, one who executes works, and to do so takes measurements and makes
      calculations. For instance, those dead men who hollowed or dressed these
      caves must have been engineers and no mean ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have such among us now,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;They raise dams and make drains
      and houses, though not so good as those which were built of old. But again
      I ask&mdash;what have you learned, O wise Engineer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only that here we stand not so very far above the city Harmac, of which I
      chanced to take the level, and that behind yonder chair there was, I
      think, once a passage which has been built up. But be pleased to say
      nothing of the matter, Lady, and to ask me no more questions at present,
      as I cannot answer them with certainty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you are discreet as well as wise,&rdquo; she replied with some
      sarcasm. &ldquo;Well, since I may not be trusted with your counsel, keep it to
      yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver bowed and obeyed this curt instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we began our return journey, passing many more groups of skeletons
      which now we scarcely troubled to look at, perhaps because the heavy air
      filled with dust that once had been the flesh of men, was telling on our
      energies. Only I noticed, or rather the observant Quick called my
      attention to the fact, that as we went the kings in their chairs were
      surrounded by fewer and fewer attendants and women, and that the offerings
      placed at their feet were of an ever-lessening value. Indeed, after we had
      passed another five or six of them, their murdered retinues dwindled to a
      few female skeletons, doubtless those of favourite wives who had been
      singled out for this particular honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there were none at all, the poor monarchs, who now were crowded
      close together, being left to explore the shades alone, adorned merely
      with their own jewellery and regalia. Ultimately even these were replaced
      by funeral gold-foil ornaments, and the trays of treasure by earthenware
      jars which appeared to have contained nothing but food and wine, and added
      to these a few spears and other weapons. The last of the occupied chairs,
      for there were empty ones beyond, contained bones which, from their
      slenderness and the small size of the bracelets among them, I saw at once
      had belonged to a woman who had been sent to the grave without companions
      or any offerings at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless,&rdquo; said Maqueda, when I pointed this out to her, &ldquo;at that time
      the ancients had grown weak and poor, since after so many kings they
      permitted a woman to rule over them and had no wealth to waste upon her
      burial. That may have been after the earthquake, when only a few people
      were left in Mur before the Abati took possession of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, then, are those of your own house buried?&rdquo; asked Oliver, staring
      at the empty chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! not in this place,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I have told you it was discovered
      but a few years ago. We rest in tombs outside, and for my part I will
      sleep in the simple earth, so that I may live on in grass and flowers, if
      in no other way. But enough of death and doom. Soon, who can tell how
      soon? we shall be as these are,&rdquo; and she shuddered. &ldquo;Meanwhile, we
      breathe, so let us make the best of breath. You have seen your fee, say,
      does it content you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What fee?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Death, the reward of Life? How can I tell until I
      have passed its gate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here this philosophical discussion was interrupted by the sudden decease
      of Quick&rsquo;s lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought there was something wrong with the blooming thing,&rdquo; said the
      Sergeant, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t turn it up, as it hasn&rsquo;t got a screw, without
      which these old-fashioned colza oils never were no good. Hullo! Doctor,
      there goes yours,&rdquo; and as he spoke, go it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wicks!&rdquo; exclaimed Maqueda, &ldquo;we forgot to bring new wicks, and without
      them of what use is oil? Come, be swift; we are still far from the mouth
      of this cave, where none except the high priests will dare to seek us,&rdquo;
       and, taking Oliver by the hand, she began to run, leaving us two to follow
      as best we could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Steady, Doctor,&rdquo; said Quick, &ldquo;steady. In the presence of disaster
      comrades should always stick together, as it says in the Red-book
      presented by the crown to warrant officers, but paid for out of their
      deferred allowance. Take my arm, Doctor. Ah! I thought so, the more haste
      the less speed. Look there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the flying shapes ahead,
      now a long way off, and with only one lamp between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next instant Maqueda turned round holding up this remaining lamp and
      called to us. I saw the faint light gleam upon her beautiful face and
      glitter down the silver ornaments of her dress. Very wild and strange she
      looked in that huge vault, seen thus for a single moment, then seen no
      more, for presently where the flame had been was but a red spark, and then
      nothing at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop still till we come back to you,&rdquo; cried Oliver, &ldquo;and shout at
      intervals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Quick, and instantly let off a fearful yell, which echoed
      backward and forward across the vault till I was quite bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, coming,&rdquo; answered Oliver, and his voice sounded so far to the
      left that Quick thought it wise to yell again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut a long story short, we next heard him on our right and then behind
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t trust sounds here, sir, echoes are too uncertain,&rdquo; said the
      Sergeant; &ldquo;but come on, I think I&rsquo;ve placed them now,&rdquo; and calling to <i>them</i>
      not to move, we headed in what we were sure was the right direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of that adventure was that presently I tripped up over a skeleton
      and found myself lying half stunned amidst trays of treasure,
      affectionately clasping a skull under the impression that it was Quick&rsquo;s
      boot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hauled me up again somehow, and, as we did not know what to do, we sat
      down amidst the dead and listened. By now the others were apparently so
      far off that the sound of Oliver&rsquo;s calling only reached us in faint,
      mysterious notes that came from we knew not whence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As, like idiots, we started in such a hurry that we forgot to bring any
      matches with us, there is nothing to be done, except wait,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;No
      doubt in due course those Abati will get over their fear of ghosts and
      come to look for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wish I could do the same, sir. I didn&rsquo;t mind those deaders in the light,
      but the dark&rsquo;s a different matter. Can&rsquo;t you hear them rattling their
      shanks and talking all round us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I do hear something,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I think it must be the
      echo of our own voices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let us hold our jaw, sir, and perhaps they will hold theirs, for
      this kind of conversation ain&rsquo;t nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we were silent, but the strange murmuring still went on, coming
      apparently from the wall of the cave behind us, and it occurred to me that
      I had once heard something like it before, though at the time I could not
      think where. Afterwards I remembered that it was when, as a boy, I had
      been taken to see the Whispering Gallery in St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral in
      London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour or so went by in this fashion, and still there were no signs
      of the Abati or of our missing pair. Quick began to fumble among his
      clothes. I asked him what he was doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help thinking I&rsquo;ve got a wax match somewhere, Doctor. I remember
      feeling it in one of the pockets of this coat on the day before we left
      London, and thinking afterwards it wasn&rsquo;t safe to have had it packed in a
      box marked &lsquo;Hold.&rsquo; Now if only I could find that match, we have got plenty
      of torches, for I&rsquo;ve stuck to my bundle all through, although I never
      thought of them when the lamps were going out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having small belief in the Sergeant&rsquo;s match, I made no answer, and the
      search went on till presently I heard him ejaculate:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Jingo, here it is, in the lining. Yes, and the head feels all right.
      Now, Doctor, hold two of the torches toward me; make ready, present,
      fire!&rdquo; and he struck the match and applied it to the heads of the resinous
      torches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly these blazed up, giving an intense light in that awful darkness.
      By this light, for one moment only, we saw a strange, and not unattractive
      spectacle. I think I forgot to say that in the centre of this vault stood
      a kind of altar, which until that moment, indeed, I had not seen. This
      altar, which, doubtless, had been used for ceremonial purposes at the
      funerals of the ancient Kings, consisted of a plain block of basalt stone,
      whereon was cut the symbol of a human eye, the stone being approached by
      steps and supported upon carved and crouching sphinxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the lowest of these steps, near enough to enable us to see them quite
      clearly, were seated Oliver Orme and Maqueda, Child of Kings. They were
      seated very close together; indeed, if I must tell the truth, Oliver&rsquo;s arm
      was about Maqueda&rsquo;s waist, her head rested upon his shoulder, and
      apparently he was engaged in kissing her upon the lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right about face,&rdquo; hissed the Sergeant, in a tone of command, &ldquo;and mark
      time!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we right-abouted for a decent period, then, coughing loudly&mdash;because
      of the irritant smoke of the torches&mdash;advanced to cross the cavern,
      and by accident stumbled upon our lost companions. I confess that I had
      nothing to say, but Quick rose to the occasion nobly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see you, Captain,&rdquo; he said to Oliver. &ldquo;Was getting very anxious
      about you, sir, until by good luck I found a match in the lining of my
      coat. If the Professor had been here he&rsquo;d have had plenty, which is an
      argument in favour of continuous smoking, even when ladies are present.
      Ah! no wonder her Majesty is faint in this hot place, poor young thing.
      It&rsquo;s lucky you didn&rsquo;t leave hold of her, sir. Do you think you could
      manage to support her, sir, as we ought to be moving. Can&rsquo;t offer to do so
      myself, as I have lamed my foot with the tooth of a dead king, also my
      arms are full of torches. But if you prefer the Doctor&mdash;what do you
      say, sir? That you <i>can</i> manage? There is such an echo in this vault
      that it is difficult to hear&mdash;very well, let us go on, for these
      torches won&rsquo;t last for ever, and you wouldn&rsquo;t like us to have to spend a
      whole night here with the lady in such a delicate condition, would you,
      especially as those nasty-tempered Abati might say that you had done it on
      purpose? Take her Majesty&rsquo;s arm, Doctor, and let us trek. I&rsquo;ll go ahead
      with the torches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To all this artless harangue Oliver answered not a single word, but glared
      at us suspiciously over the shape of Maqueda, who apparently had fainted.
      Only when I ventured to offer her some professional assistance she
      recovered, and said that she could get on quite well alone, which meant
      upon Orme&rsquo;s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the end of it was that she got on, and so did we, for the torches
      lasted until we reached the narrow, sloping passage, and, rounding the
      corner, saw the lantern burning in the hole in the wall, after which, of
      course, things were easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said Oliver to me in a voice of studied nonchalance that night,
      as we were preparing to turn in, &ldquo;did you notice anything in the Vault of
      Kings this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;lots! Of course, myself, I am not given to
      archæology, like poor Higgs, but the sight struck me as absolutely unique.
      If I were inclined to moralize, for instance, what a contrast between
      those dead rulers and their young and beautiful successor, full of life
      and love&rdquo;&mdash;here he looked at me sharply&mdash;&ldquo;love of her people,
      such as I have no doubt in their day&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, shut it, Adams! I don&rsquo;t want a philosophical lecture with historical
      comparisons. Did you notice anything except bones and gold when that
      unutterable ass, Quick, suddenly turned on the lights&mdash;I mean struck
      the match which unfortunately he had with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I gave it up and faced the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you want the truth,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not <i>very</i> much myself, for
      my sight isn&rsquo;t as good as it used to be. But the Sergeant, who has
      extraordinarily sharp eyes, thought that he saw you kissing Maqueda, a
      supposition that your relative attitudes seemed to confirm, which
      explains, moreover, some of the curious sounds we heard before he lit the
      torches. That&rsquo;s why he asked me to turn my back. But, of course, we may
      have been mistaken. Do I understand you to say that the Sergeant was
      mistaken?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver consigned the Sergeant&rsquo;s eyes to an ultimate fate worse than that
      which befell those of Peeping Tom; then, in a burst of candour, for
      subterfuge never was his forte, owned up:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made no mistake,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we love each other, and it came out
      suddenly in the dark. I suppose that the unusual surroundings acted on our
      nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From a moral point of view I am glad that you love each other,&rdquo; I
      remarked, &ldquo;since embraces that are merely nervous cannot be commended. But
      from every other, in our circumstances the resulting situation strikes me
      as a little short of awful, although Quick, a most observant man, warned
      me to expect it from the first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse Quick,&rdquo; said Oliver again, with the utmost energy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him a
      month&rsquo;s notice this very night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;for then you&rsquo;ll oblige him to take service with Barung,
      where he would be most dangerous. Look here, Orme, to drop chaff, this is
      a pretty mess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s wrong about it, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked indignantly. &ldquo;Of course,
      she&rsquo;s a Jew of some diluted sort or other, and I&rsquo;m a Christian; but those
      things adapt themselves. Of course, too, she&rsquo;s my superior, but after all
      hers is a strictly local rank, and in Europe we should be on much the same
      footing. As for her being an Eastern, what does that matter? Surely it is
      not an objection which should have weight with <i>you</i>. And for the
      rest, did you ever see her equal?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never, never, <i>never</i>!&rdquo; I answered with enthusiasm. &ldquo;The young lady
      to whom any gentleman has just engaged himself is always absolutely
      unequalled, and, let me admit at once that this is perhaps the most
      original and charming that I have ever met in all Central Africa. Only,
      whatever may be the case with you, I don&rsquo;t know whether this fact will
      console me and Quick when our throats are being cut. Look here, Orme,&rdquo; I
      added, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t I tell you long ago that the one thing you must <i>not</i>
      do was to make love to the Child of Kings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you? Really, I forget; you told me such a lot of things, Doctor,&rdquo; he
      answered coolly enough, only unfortunately the colour that rose in his
      cheeks betrayed his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Quick, who had entered the room unobserved, gave a dry
      cough, and remarked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blame the Captain, Doctor, because he don&rsquo;t remember. There&rsquo;s
      nothing like shock from an explosion for upsetting the memory. I&rsquo;ve seen
      that often in the Boer war, when, after a big shell had gone off somewhere
      near them, the very bravest soldiers would clean forget that it was their
      duty to stand still and not run like rabbits; indeed, it happened to me
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I laughed, and Oliver said something which I could not hear, but Quick
      went on imperturbably:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still, truth is truth, and if the Captain has forgotten, the more reason
      that we should remind him. That evening at the Professor&rsquo;s house in London
      you did warn him, sir, and he answered that you needn&rsquo;t bother your head
      about the fascinations of a nigger woman&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nigger woman,&rdquo; broke out Oliver; &ldquo;I never used such words; I never even
      thought them, and you are an impertinent fellow to put them into my mouth.
      Nigger woman! Good heavens! It&rsquo;s desecration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry, Captain, now I come to think of it, I believe you said black
      woman, speaking in your haste. Yes and I begged you not to brag, seeing
      that if you did we might live to see you crawling after her, with myself,
      Samuel Quick bringing up the rear. Well, there it is we are, and the worst
      of it is that I can&rsquo;t blame you, being as anticipated in the prophecy&mdash;for
      that&rsquo;s what it was though I didn&rsquo;t know it myself at the time&mdash;exactly
      in the same state myself, though, of course, at a distance, bringing up
      the rear respectfully, as said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you are in love with the Child of Kings?&rdquo; said
      Oliver, staring at the Sergeant&rsquo;s grim and battered figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begging your pardon, Captain, that is exactly what I do mean. If a cat
      may look at a queen, why mayn&rsquo;t a man love her? Howsoever, my kind of love
      ain&rsquo;t likely to interfere with yours. My kind means sentry-go and perhaps
      a knife in my gizzard; yours&mdash;well, we saw what yours means this
      afternoon, though what it will all lead to we didn&rsquo;t see. Still, Captain,
      speaking as one who hasn&rsquo;t been keen on the sex heretofore, I say&mdash;sail
      in, since it&rsquo;s worth it, even if you&rsquo;ve got to sink afterwards, for this
      lady, although she is half a Jew, and I never could abide Jews, is the
      sweetest and the loveliest and the best and the bravest little woman that
      ever walked God&rsquo;s earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point Oliver seized his hand and shook it warmly, and I may
      mention that I think some report of Quick&rsquo;s summary of her character must
      have reached Maqueda&rsquo;s ears. At any rate, thenceforward until the end she
      always treated the old fellow with what the French call the &ldquo;most
      distinguished consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, as I was not in love, no one shook my hand, so, leaving the other two
      to discuss the virtues and graces of the Child of Kings, I went off to bed
      filled with the gloomiest forbodings. What a fool I had been not to insist
      that whatever expert accompanied Higgs should be a married man. And yet,
      now when I came to think of it, that might not have bettered matters, and
      perhaps would only have added to the transaction a degree of moral
      turpitude which at present was lacking, since even married men are
      sometimes weak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was that Maqueda&rsquo;s attractions were extraordinarily great. To
      her remarkable beauty she added a wonderful charm of manner and force of
      mind. Also her situation must touch the heart and pity of any man, so
      helpless was she in the midst of all her hollow grandeur, so lonely
      amongst a nation of curs whom she strove in vain to save, and should she
      escape destruction with them, doomed to so sad and repulsive a fate,
      namely to become the wife of a fat poltroon who was her own uncle. Well,
      we know to what emotion pity is akin, and the catastrophe had occurred a
      little sooner than I had expected, that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless to her, in comparison with the men to whom she was accustomed
      and allowed by etiquette to take as her associates, this brave and
      handsome young Englishman, who had come into her care sick and shattered
      after the doing of a great deed, must have seemed a veritable fairy
      prince. And she had helped to nurse him, and he had shown himself grateful
      for her kindness and condescension, and&mdash;the rest followed, as surely
      as the day follows the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how would it end? Sooner or later the secret must come out, for
      already the Abati nobles, if I may call them so for want of a better name,
      and especially Joshua, were bitterly jealous of the favour their lady
      showed to the foreigner, and watched them both. Then what&mdash;what would
      happen? Under the Abati law it was death for any one outside of the
      permitted degree of relationship to tamper with the affections of the
      Child of Kings. Nor was this wonderful, since that person held her seat in
      virtue of her supposed direct descent from Solomon and the first Maqueda,
      Queen of Sheba, and therefore the introduction of any alien blood could
      not be tolerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Orme, having sworn an oath of allegiance, had become subject to
      those laws. Lastly, I could not in the least hope from the character of
      the pair concerned that this was but a passing flirtation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! without a doubt these two had signed their own death-warrant yonder in
      the Cave of Death, and incidentally ours also. This must be the end of our
      adventure and my long search for the son whom I had lost.

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RESCUE FAILS
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our breakfast on the following morning was a somewhat gloomy meal. By
      common consent no allusion was made to the events of the previous day, or
      to our conversation at bedtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, there was no talk at all to speak of, since, not knowing what else
      to do, I thought I could best show my attitude of mind by preserving a
      severe silence, while Quick seemed to be absorbed in philosophical
      reflections, and Orme looked rather excited and dishevelled, as though he
      had been writing poetry, as I daresay was the case. In the midst of this
      dreary meal a messenger arrived, who announced that the Walda Nagasta
      would be pleased to see us all within half-an-hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing lest Orme should say something foolish, I answered briefly that we
      would wait upon her, and the man went, leaving us wondering what had
      happened to cause her to desire our presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed time we were shown into the small audience room, and, as
      we passed its door, I ventured to whisper to Oliver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For your own sake and hers, as well as that of the rest of us, I implore
      you to be careful. Your face is watched as well as your words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, old fellow,&rdquo; he answered, colouring a little. &ldquo;You may trust
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could,&rdquo; I muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we were shown in ceremoniously, and made our bows to Maqueda, who was
      seated, surrounded by some of the judges and officers, among them, Prince
      Joshua, and talking to two rough-looking men clad in ordinary brown robes.
      She greeted us, and after the exchange of the usual compliments, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I have summoned you for this reason. This morning when the
      traitor Shadrach was being led out to execution at the hands of these men,
      the officers of the law, he begged for a delay. When asked why, as his
      petition for reprieve had been refused, he said that if his life was
      spared he could show how your companion, he whom they call Black Windows,
      may be rescued from the Fung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Orme and I in one breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;but wisely they spared the man. Let him be
      brought in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A door opened, and Shadrach entered, his hands bound behind his back and
      shackles on his feet. He was a very fearful and much chastened Shadrach,
      for his eyes rolled and his teeth chattered with terror, as, having
      prostrated himself to the Walda Nagasta, he wriggled round and tried to
      kiss Orme&rsquo;s boot. The guards pulled him to his feet again, and Maqueda
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you to tell us, traitor, before you die?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The thing is secret, O Bud of the Rose. Must I speak before so many?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she answered, and ordered most of those present to leave the room,
      including the executioners and soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The man is desperate, and there will be none left to guard him,&rdquo; said
      Joshua nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that, your Highness,&rdquo; answered Quick in his bad Arabic, and
      stepping up behind Shadrach he added in English, &ldquo;Now then, Pussy, you
      behave, or it will be the worse for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When all had gone again Shadrach was commanded to speak and say how he
      could save the Englishman whom he had betrayed into the hands of the Fung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thus, Child of Kings,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;Black Windows, as we know, is
      imprisoned in the body of the great idol.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you know it, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lady, I do know it, and also the Sultan said so, did he not? Well, I
      can show a secret road to that idol whence he may be reached and rescued.
      In my boyhood I, who am called Cat, because I can climb so well, found
      that road, and when the Fung took me afterward and threw me to the lions,
      where I got these scars upon my face, by it I escaped. Spare me, and I
      will show it to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not enough to show the road,&rdquo; said Maqueda. &ldquo;Dog, you must save the
      foreign lord whom you betrayed. If you do not save him you die. Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a hard saying, Lady,&rdquo; answered the man. &ldquo;Am I God that I should
      promise to save this stranger who perchance is already dead? Yet I will do
      my best, knowing that if I fail you will kill me, and that if I succeed I
      shall be spared. At any rate, I will show you the road to where he is or
      was imprisoned, although I warn you that it is a rough one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where you can travel we can follow,&rdquo; said Maqueda. &ldquo;Tell us now what we
      must do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he told her, and when he had done the Prince Joshua intervened, saying
      that it was not fitting that the Child of Kings in her own sacred person
      should undertake such a dangerous journey. She listened to his
      remonstrances and thanked him for his care of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I am going,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;not for the sake of the stranger who is
      called Black Windows, but because, if there is a secret way out of Mur I
      think it well that I should know that way. Yet I agree with you, my uncle,
      that on such a journey I ought not to be unprotected, and therefore I pray
      that you will be ready to start with us at noon, since I am sure that then
      we shall all be safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Joshua began to make excuses, but she would not listen to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are too honest. The honour of the Abati is
      involved in this manner, since, alas! it was an Abati that betrayed Black
      Windows, and an Abati&mdash;namely, yourself&mdash;must save him. You have
      often told me, my uncle, how clever you are at climbing rocks, and now you
      shall make proof of your skill and courage before these foreigners. It is
      a command, speak no more,&rdquo; and she rose, to show that the audience was
      finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same afternoon Shadrach, by mountain paths that were known to him,
      led a little company of people to the crest of the western precipice of
      Mur. Fifteen hundred feet or more beneath us lay the great plains upon
      which, some miles away, could be seen the city of Harmac. But the idol in
      the valley we could not see, because here the precipice bent over and hid
      it from our sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now, fellow,&rdquo; said Maqueda, who was clad in the rough sheepskin of a
      peasant woman, which somehow looked charming upon her. &ldquo;Here is the cliff,
      there lies the plain; I see no road between the two, and my wise uncle,
      the prince, tells me that he never heard of one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;now I take command, and you must follow me. But
      first let us see that nobody and nothing are lacking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went round the company and numbered them. In all we were sixteen;
      Maqueda and Joshua, we three Englishmen, armed with repeating rifles and
      revolvers, our guide Shadrach, and some picked Mountaineers chosen for
      their skill and courage. For even in Mur there were brave men left,
      especially among the shepherds and huntsmen, whose homes were on the
      cliffs. These sturdy guides were laden with ropes, lamps, and long,
      slender ladders that could be strapped together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everything had been checked and all the ladders and straps tested,
      Shadrach went to a clump of bushes which grew feebly on the wind-swept
      crest of the precipice. In the midst of these he found and removed a large
      flat stone, revealing what evidently had been the head of a stair,
      although now its steps were much worn and crumbled by the water that in
      the wet season followed this natural drain to the depths below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is that road the ancients made for purposes of their own,&rdquo; explained
      Shadrach, &ldquo;which, as I have said, I chanced to discover when I was a boy.
      But let none follow it who are afraid, for it is steep and rough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Joshua, who was already weary with his long ride and walk up to the
      crest of the precipice, implored Maqueda almost passionately to abandon
      the idea of entering this horrid hole, while Oliver backed up his
      entreaties with few words but many appealing glances, for on this point,
      though for different reasons, the prince and he were at one.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she would not listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;with you, the experienced mountaineer, why should I
      be afraid? If the Doctor here, who is old enough to be the father of
      either of us&rdquo; (so far as Joshua was concerned this remark lacked truth),
      &ldquo;is willing to go, surely I can go also? Moreover, if I remained behind,
      you would wish to stay to guard me, and never should I forgive myself if I
      deprived you of such a great adventure. Also, like you, I love climbing.
      Come, let us waste no more time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we were roped up. First went Shadrach, with Quick next to him, a
      position which the Sergeant insisted upon occupying as his custodian, and
      several of the Mountaineers, carrying ladders, lamps, oil, food and other
      things. Then in a second gang came two more of these men, Oliver, Maqueda,
      myself, and next to me, Joshua. The remaining mountaineers brought up the
      rear, carrying spare stores, ladders, and so forth. When all was ready the
      lamps were lit, and we started upon a very strange journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first two hundred feet or so the stairs, though worn and almost
      perpendicular, for the place was like the shaft of a mine, were not
      difficult to descend, to any of us except Joshua, whom I heard puffing and
      groaning behind me. Then came a gallery running eastward at a steep slope
      for perhaps fifty paces, and at the end of it a second shaft of about the
      same depth as the first, but with the stairs much more worn, apparently by
      the washing of water, of which a good deal trickled out of the sides of
      the shaft. Another difficulty was that the air rushing up from below made
      it hard to keep the lamps alight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the bottom of this section there was scarcely any stair left, and
      the climbing became very dangerous. Here, indeed, Joshua slipped, and with
      a wail of terror slid down the shaft and landed with his legs across my
      back in such a fashion that had I not happened to have good hand and foot
      hold at the time, he would have propelled me on to Maqueda, and we must
      have all rolled down headlong, probably to our deaths.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was, this fat and terrified fellow cast his arms about my neck, to
      which he clung, nearly choking me, until, just when I was about to faint
      beneath his weight and pressure, the Mountaineers in the third party
      arrived and dragged him off. When they had got him in charge, for I
      refused to move another step while he was immediately behind me, we
      descended by a ladder which the first party had set up, to the second
      level, where began another long, eastward sloping passage that ended at
      the mouth of a third pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here arose the great question as to what was to be done with the Prince
      Joshua, who vowed that he could go no farther, and demanded loudly to be
      taken back to the top of the cliff, although Shadrach assured him that
      thenceforward the road was much easier. At length we were obliged to refer
      the matter to Maqueda, who settled it in very few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you tell us that you cannot come on, and it is
      certain that we cannot spare the time and men to send you back. Therefore,
      it seems that you must stop where you are until we return, and if we
      should not return, make the best of your own way up the shaft. Farewell,
      my uncle, this place is safe and comfortable, and if you are wise you will
      rest awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heartless woman!&rdquo; gobbled Joshua, who was shaking like a jelly with fear
      and rage. &ldquo;Would you leave your affianced lord and lover alone in this
      haunted hole while you scramble down rocks like a wild cat with strangers?
      If I must stay, do you stay with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Maqueda with decision. &ldquo;Shall it be said that the
      Child of Kings is afraid to go where her guests can travel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, the end of it was that Joshua came on in the centre of the third
      body of Mountaineers, who were practically obliged to carry him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach was right, since for some reason or other the stairs
      thenceforward remained more perfect. Only they seemed almost endless, and
      before we reached our goal I calculated that we must have descended quite
      twelve hundred feet into the bowels of the rock. At length, when I was
      almost tired out and Maqueda was so breathless that she was obliged to
      lean on Oliver, dragging me behind her like a dog on a string, of a sudden
      we saw a glimmer of daylight that crept into the tunnel through a small
      hole. By the mouth of yet another pit or shaft, we found Shadrach and the
      others waiting for us. Saluting, he said that we must unrope, leave our
      lamps behind, and follow him. Oliver asked him whither this last shaft
      led.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To a still lower level, lord,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but one which you will
      scarcely care to explore, since it ends in the great pit where the Fung
      keep their sacred lions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Oliver, much interested for reasons of his own, and he
      glanced at Quick, who nodded his head and whistled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we all followed Shadrach to find ourselves presently upon a plateau
      about the size of a racquet court which, either by nature or by the hand
      of man, had been recessed into the face of that gigantic cliff. Going to
      the edge of this plateau, whereon grew many tree-ferns and some thick
      green bushes that would have made us invisible from below even had there
      been any one to see us, we saw that the sheer precipice ran down beneath
      for several hundred feet. Of these yawning depths, however, we did not at
      the moment make out much, partly because they were plunged in shadow and
      partly for another reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rising out of the gulf below was what we took at first to be a rounded
      hill of black rock, oblong in shape, from which projected a gigantic shaft
      of stone ending in a kind of fretted bush that alone was of the size of a
      cottage. The point of this bush-like rock was exactly opposite the little
      plateau on to which we had emerged and distant from it not more than
      thirty, or at most, forty feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Maqueda, of Shadrach, pointing in front of her, as
      she handed back to one of the Mountaineers a cup from which she had been
      drinking water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, O Walda Nagasta,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;is nothing else than the back of
      the mighty idol of the Fung, which is shaped like a lion. The great shaft
      of rock with the bush at the end of it is the tail of the lion. Doubtless
      this platform on which we stand is a place whence the old priests, when
      they owned Mur as well as the land of the Fung, used to hide themselves to
      watch whatever it was they wanted to see. Look,&rdquo; and he pointed to certain
      grooves in the face of the rock, &ldquo;I think that here there was once a
      bridge which could be let down at will on to the tail of the lion-god,
      though long ago it has rotted away. Yet ere now I have travelled this road
      without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We stared at him astonished, and in the silence that followed I heard
      Maqueda whisper to Oliver:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that is how he whom we call Cat escaped from the Fung; or perhaps
      that is how he communicates with them as a spy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps he is a liar, my Lady,&rdquo; interrupted Quick, who had also
      overheard their talk, a solution which, I confess, commended itself to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why have you brought us here?&rdquo; asked Maqueda presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I not tell you in Mur, Lady&mdash;to rescue Black Windows? Listen,
      now, it is the custom of the Fung to allow those who are imprisoned within
      the idol to walk unguarded upon its back at dawn and sunset. At least,
      this is their custom with Black Windows&mdash;ask me not how I know it;
      this is truth, I swear it on my life, which is at stake. Now this is my
      plan. We have with us a ladder which will reach from where we stand to the
      tail of the idol. Should the foreign lord appear upon the back of the god,
      which, if he still lives, as I believe he does, he is almost sure to do at
      sundown, as a man who dwells in the dark all day will love the light and
      air when he can get them, then some of us must cross and bring him back
      with us. Perhaps it had best be you, my lord Orme, since if I went alone,
      or even with these men, after what is past Black Windows might not
      altogether trust me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fool,&rdquo; broke in Maqueda, &ldquo;how can a man do such a thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Lady, it is not so difficult as it looks. A few steps across the gulf,
      and then a hundred feet or so along the tail of the lion which is flat on
      the top and so broad that one may run down it if careful to follow the
      curves, that is on a still day&mdash;nothing more. But, of course, if the
      Lord Orme is afraid, which I did not think who have heard so much of his
      courage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and the rogue shrugged his shoulders and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid, fellow,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;well, I am not ashamed to be afraid of
      such a journey. Yet if there is need I will make it, though not before I
      see my brother alone yonder on the rock, since all this may be but a trick
      of yours to deliver me to the Fung, among whom I know that you have
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is madness; you shall not go,&rdquo; said Maqueda. &ldquo;You will fall and be
      dashed to pieces. I say that you shall not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he not go, my niece?&rdquo; interrupted Joshua. &ldquo;Shadrach is right;
      we have heard much of the courage of this Gentile. Now let us see him do
      something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned on the Prince like a tiger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good, my uncle, then you shall go with him. Surely one of the
      ancient blood of the Abati will not shirk from what a &lsquo;Gentile&rsquo; dares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this Joshua relapsed into silence, and I have no clear memory
      of what he did or said in connection with the rest of that thrilling
      scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now followed a pause in the midst of which Oliver sat down and began to
      take off his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you undress yourself, friend?&rdquo; asked Maqueda nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Lady,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if I have to walk yonder road it is safer
      to do so in my stockings. Have no fear,&rdquo; he added gently, &ldquo;from boyhood I
      have been accustomed to such feats, and when I served in my country&rsquo;s army
      it was my pleasure to give instruction in them, although it is true that
      this one surpasses all that ever I attempted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Still I do fear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Quick had sat down and begun to take off <i>his</i> boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing, Sergeant?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Getting ready to accompany the Captain upon forlorn hope, Doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are too old for the game, Sergeant. If any one
      goes, I should, seeing that I believe my son is over there, but I can&rsquo;t
      try it, as I know my head would give out, and I should fall in a second,
      which would only upset everybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; broke in Oliver, who had overheard us, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in command here,
      and my orders are that neither of you shall come. Remember, Sergeant, that
      if anything happens to me it is your business to take over the stores and
      use them if necessary, which you alone can do. Now go and see to the
      preparations, and find out the plan of campaign, for I want to rest and
      keep quiet. I daresay the whole thing is humbug, and we shall see nothing
      of the Professor; still, one may as well be prepared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Quick and I went to superintend the lashing of two of the light ladders
      together and the securing of some planks which we had brought with us upon
      the top of the rungs, so as to make these ladders easy to walk on. I asked
      who would be of the party besides Shadrach and Orme, and was told no one,
      as all were afraid. Ultimately, however, a man named Japhet, one of the
      Mountaineers, volunteered upon being promised a grant of land from the
      Child of Kings herself, which grant she proclaimed before them all was to
      be given to his relatives in the event of his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length everything was ready, and there came another spell of silence,
      for the nerves of all of us were so strained that we did not seem able to
      talk. It was broken by a sound of sudden and terrible roaring that arose
      from the gulf beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the hour of the feeding of the sacred lions which the Fung keep in
      the pit about the base of the idol,&rdquo; explained Shadrach. Then he added,
      &ldquo;Unless he should be rescued, I believe that Black Windows will be given
      to the lions to-night, which is that of full moon and a festival of
      Harmac, though maybe he will be kept till the next full moon when all the
      Fung come up to worship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information did not tend to raise anyone&rsquo;s spirits, although Quick,
      who always tried to be cheerful, remarked that it was probably false.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadows began to gather in the Valley of Harmac, whereby we knew that
      the sun was setting behind the mountains. Indeed, had it not been for a
      clear and curious glow reflected from the eastern sky, the gulf would have
      plunged us in gloom. Presently, far away upon a rise of rock which we knew
      must be the sphinx head of the huge idol, a little figure appeared
      outlined against the sky, and there began to sing. The moment that I heard
      the distant voice I went near to fainting, and indeed should have fallen
      had not Quick caught me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Adams?&rdquo; asked Oliver, looking up from where he and Maqueda
      sat whispering to each other while the fat Joshua glowered at them in the
      background. &ldquo;Has Higgs appeared?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but, thank God, my son still lives. That is his voice.
      Oh! if you can, save him, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now there was much suppressed excitement, and some one thrust a pair of
      field-glasses into my hand, but either they were wrongly set or the state
      of my nerves would not allow me to see through them. So Quick took them
      and reported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tall, slim figure wearing a white robe, but at the distance in this light
      can&rsquo;t make out the face. One might hail him, perhaps, only it would give
      us away. Ah! the hymn is done and he&rsquo;s gone; seemed to jump into a hole in
      the rock, which shows that he&rsquo;s all right, anyway, or he couldn&rsquo;t jump. So
      cheer up, Doctor, for you have much to be thankful for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I repeated after him, &ldquo;much to be thankful for, but still I would
      that I had more after all these years to search. To think that I should be
      so close to him and he know nothing of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the ceasing of the song and the departure of my son, there appeared
      upon the back of the idol three Fung warriors, fine fellows clad in long
      robes and armed with spears, and behind them a trumpeter who carried a
      horn or hollowed elephant&rsquo;s tusk. These men marched up and down the length
      of the platform from the rise of the neck to the root of the tail,
      apparently to make an inspection. Having found nothing, for, of course,
      they could not see us hidden behind the bushes on our little plateau, of
      which no doubt they did not even know the existence, and much less that it
      was connected with the mountain plain of Mur, the trumpeter blew a shrill
      blast upon his horn, and before the echoes of it had died away, vanished
      with his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sunset tour of inspection. Seen the same kind of thing as at Gib.,&rdquo; said
      the Sergeant. &ldquo;Oh! by Jingo! Pussy isn&rsquo;t lying after all&mdash;there he
      is,&rdquo; and he pointed to a figure that rose suddenly out of the black stone
      of the idol&rsquo;s back just as the guards had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Higgs, Higgs without a doubt; Higgs wearing his battered sun-helmet
      and his dark spectacles; Higgs smoking his big meerschaum pipe, and
      engaged in making notes in a pocket-book as calmly as though he sat before
      a new object in the British Museum.
    </p>
    <p>
      I gasped with astonishment, for somehow I had never expected that we
      should really see him, but Orme, rising very quietly from his seat beside
      Maqueda, only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the old fellow right enough. Well, now for it. You, Shadrach,
      run out your ladder and cross first that I may be sure you play no trick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; broke in Maqueda, &ldquo;this dog shall not go, for never would he return
      from his friends the Fung. Man,&rdquo; she said, addressing Japhet, the
      Mountaineer to whom she had promised land, &ldquo;go you over first and hold the
      end of the ladder while this lord crosses. If he returns safe your reward
      is doubled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Japhet saluted, the ladder was run out and its end set upon the
      roughnesses in the rock that represented the hair of the sphinx&rsquo;s tail.
      The Mountaineer paused a moment with hands and face uplifted; evidently he
      was praying. Then bidding his companions hold the hither end of the
      ladder, and having first tested it with his foot and found that it hung
      firm, calmly he walked across, being a brave fellow, and presently was
      seen seated on the opposing mass of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now came Oliver&rsquo;s turn. He nodded to Maqueda, who went white as a sheet,
      muttering some words to her that did not reach me. Then he turned and
      shook my hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you can, save my son also,&rdquo; I whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best if I can get hold of him,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Sergeant, if
      anything happens to me you know your duty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and follow your example, Captain, under all circumstances,
      though that will be hard,&rdquo; replied Quick in a rather shaky voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stepped out on the ladder. I reckoned that twelve or fourteen short
      paces would take him across, and the first half of these he accomplished
      with quiet certainty. When he was in the exact middle of the passage,
      however, the end of one of the uprights of the ladder at the farther side
      slipped a little, notwithstanding the efforts of Japhet to keep it
      straight, with the result that the plank bound on the rungs lost its
      level, sinking an inch or so to the right, and nearly causing Oliver to
      fall from it into the gulf. He wavered like a wind-shaken reed, attempted
      to step forward, hesitated, stopped, and slowly sank on to his hands and
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ah</i>!&rdquo; panted Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Gentile has lost his head,&rdquo; began Joshua in a voice full of the
      triumph that he could not hide. &ldquo;He&mdash;will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joshua got no further, for Quick, turning, threatened him savagely with
      his fist, saying in English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stow your jaw if you don&rsquo;t want to follow him, you swine,&rdquo; whereon
      Joshua, who understood the gesture, if not the words, relapsed into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Mountaineer on the farther side spoke, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have no fear, the ladder is safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Oliver remained in his crouching posture on the board, which
      was all that separated him from an awful death in the gulf beneath. Next,
      while we watched, agonized, he rose to his feet again, and with perfect
      calmness walked across to its other end.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done our side!&rdquo; said Quick, addressing Joshua, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t your Royal
      Highness cheer? No, you leave that knife alone, or presently there&rsquo;ll be a
      hog the less in this world,&rdquo; and stooping down he relieved the Prince of
      the weapon which he was fingering with his round eyes fixed upon the
      Sergeant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda, who had noted all, now interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;brave men are risking their lives yonder while we
      sit in safety. Be silent and cease from quarrelling, I pray you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next moment we had forgotten all about Joshua, being utterly absorbed in
      watching the drama in progress upon the farther side of the gulf. After a
      slight pause to recover his nerve or breath, Orme rose, and preceded by
      Japhet, climbed up the bush-like rock till he reached the shaft of the
      sphinx&rsquo;s tail. Here he turned and waved his hand to us, then following the
      Mountaineer, walked, apparently with the utmost confidence, along the
      curves of the tail to where it sprang from the body of the idol. At this
      spot there was a little difficulty in climbing over the smooth slope of
      rock on to the broad terrace-like back. Soon, however, they surmounted it,
      and vanishing for a few seconds into the hollow of the loins, which, of
      course, was a good many feet deep, re-appeared moving toward the
      shoulders. Between these we could see Higgs standing with his back toward
      us, utterly unconscious of all that was passing behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing Japhet, Oliver walked up to the Professor and touched him on the
      arm. Higgs turned, stared at the pair for a moment, and then, in his
      astonishment, or so we guessed, sat down plump upon the rock. They pulled
      him to his feet, Orme pointing to the cliff behind, and evidently
      explaining the situation and what must be done. Then followed a short and
      animated talk. Through the glasses we could even see Higgs shaking his
      head. He told them something, they came to a determination, for now he
      turned, stepped forward a pace or two, and vanished, as I learnt
      afterwards, to fetch my son, without whom he would not try to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      A while went by; it seemed an age, but really was under a minute. We heard
      the sound of shouts. Higgs&rsquo;s white helmet reappeared, and then his body,
      with two Fung guards clinging on to him. He yelled out in English and the
      words reached us faintly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Save yourself! I&rsquo;ll hold these devils. Run, you infernal fool, run!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver hesitated, although the Mountaineer was pulling at him, till the
      heads of more Fung appeared. Then, with a gesture of despair, he turned
      and fled. First ran Oliver, then Japhet, whom he had outpaced, and after
      them came a number of priests or guards, waving knives, while in the
      background Higgs rolled on the rock with his captors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest was very short. Orme slid down the rump of the idol on to the
      tail, followed by the Mountaineer, and after them in single file came
      three Fung, who apparently thought no more of the perilous nature of their
      foothold than do the sheiks of the Egyptian pyramids when they swarm about
      those monuments like lizards. Nor, for the matter of that, did Oliver or
      Japhet, who doubled down the tail as though it were a race track. Oliver
      swung himself on to the ladder, and in a second was half across it, we
      holding its other end, when suddenly he heard his companion cry out. A
      Fung had got hold of Japhet by the leg and he lay face downward on the
      board.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver halted and slowly turned round, drawing his revolver as he did so.
      Then he aimed and fired, and the Fung, leaving go of Japhet&rsquo;s leg, threw
      up his arms and plunged headlong into the gulf beneath. The next thing I
      remember is that they were both among us, and somebody shouted, &ldquo;Pull in
      the ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Quick, &ldquo;wait a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Vaguely I wondered why, till I perceived that three of those courageous
      Fung were following across it, resting their hands upon each other&rsquo;s
      shoulders, while their companions cheered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, pull, brothers, pull!&rdquo; shouted the Sergeant, and pull we did. Poor
      Fung! they deserved a better fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always inflict loss upon the enemy when you get a chance,&rdquo; remarked the
      Sergeant, as he opened fire with his repeating rifle upon other Fung who
      by now were clustering upon the back of the idol. This position, however,
      they soon abandoned as untenable, except one or two of them who remained
      there, dead or wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed, in the midst of which I heard Quick saying to Joshua
      in his very worst Arabic:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now does your Royal Highness think that we Gentiles are cowards, although
      it is true those Fung are as good men as we any day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Joshua declined argument, and I turned to watch Oliver, who had covered
      his face with his hands, and seemed to be weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, O friend, what is it?&rdquo; I heard Maqueda say in her gentle
      voice&mdash;a voice full of tears, tears of gratitude I think. &ldquo;You have
      done a great deed; you have returned safe; all is well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; he answered, forgetting her titles in his distress, &ldquo;all is ill. I
      have failed, and to-night they throw my brother to the lions. He told me
      so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda, finding no answer, stretched out her hand to the Mountaineer, his
      companion in adventure, who kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Japhet,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am proud of you; your reward is fourfold, and
      henceforth you are a captain of my Mountaineers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us what happened,&rdquo; I said to Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he answered: &ldquo;I remembered about your son, and so did Higgs. In
      fact, he spoke of him first&mdash;they seem to have become friends. He
      said he would not escape without him, and could fetch him in a moment, as
      he was only just below. Well, he went to do so, and must have found the
      guard instead, who, I suppose, had heard us talking. You know as much
      about the rest as I do. To-night, when the full moon is two hours high,
      there is to be a ceremony of sacrifice, and poor Higgs will be let down
      into the den of lions. He was writing his will in a note-book when we saw
      him, as Barung had promised to send it to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the Sergeant, in a confidential voice, when he had digested
      this information, &ldquo;would you translate for me a bit, as I want to have a
      talk with Cat there, and my Arabic don&rsquo;t run to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I nodded, and we went to that corner of the plateau where Shadrach stood
      apart, watching and listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Cat,&rdquo; said the Sergeant (I give his remarks in his own language,
      leaving out my rendering) &ldquo;just listen to me, and understand that if you
      tell lies or play games either you or I don&rsquo;t reach the top of this cliff
      again alive. Do you catch on?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach replied that he caught on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. You&rsquo;ve told us that once you were a prisoner among the Fung
      and thrown to these holy lions, but got out. Now just explain what
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, O Quick. After ceremonies that do not matter, I was let down in the
      food-basket into the feeding-den, and thrown out of the basket like any
      other meat. Then the gates were lifted up by the chains, and the lions
      came in to devour me according to their custom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what happened next, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened? Why, of course I hid myself in the shadow as much as
      possible, right against the walls of the precipice, until a satan of a
      she-lion snuffled me out and gave a stroke at me. Look, here are the marks
      of her claws,&rdquo; and he pointed to the scars upon his face. &ldquo;Those claws
      stung like scorpions; they made me mad. The terror which I had lost when I
      saw their yellow eyes came back to me. I rushed at the precipice as a cat
      that is hunted by a dog rushes at a wall. I clung to its smooth side with
      my nails, with my toes, with my teeth. A lion leaped up and tore the flesh
      of my leg, here, here,&rdquo; and he showed the marks, which we could scarcely
      see in that dim light. &ldquo;He ran back for another spring. Above me I saw a
      tiny ledge, big enough for a hawk to sit on&mdash;no more. I jumped, I
      caught it, drawing up my legs so that the lion missed me. I made the
      effort a man makes once in his life. Somehow I dragged myself to that
      ledge; I rested one thigh upon it and pressed against the rock to steady
      myself. Then the rock gave, and I tumbled backward into the bottom of a
      tunnel. Afterwards I escaped to the top of the cliff in the dark, O God of
      Israel! in the dark, smelling my way, climbing like a baboon, risking
      death a thousand times. It took me two whole days and nights, and the last
      of those nights I knew not what I did. Yet I found my way, and that is why
      my people name me Cat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Quick in a new and more respectful voice, &ldquo;and
      however big a rascal you may be, you&rsquo;ve got pluck. Now, say, remembering
      what I told you,&rdquo; and he tapped the handle of his revolver, &ldquo;is that
      feeding-den where it used to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe so, O Quick; why should it be changed? The victims are let down
      from the belly of the god, just there between his thighs where are doors.
      The feeding-place lies in a hollow of the cliff; this platform on which we
      stand is over it. None saw my escape, therefore none searched for the
      means of it, since they thought that the lions had devoured me, as they
      have devoured thousands. No one enters there, only when the beasts have
      fed full they draw back to their sleeping-dens, and those who watch above
      let down the bars. Listen,&rdquo; and as he spoke we heard a crash and a rattle
      far below. &ldquo;They fall now, the lions having eaten. When Black Windows and
      perhaps others are thrown to them, by and by, they will be drawn up
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that hole in the rock still there, Shadrach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without doubt, though I have not been down to look.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, my boy, you are going now,&rdquo; remarked Quick grimly.

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE DEN OF LIONS
    </h3>
    <p>
      We returned to the others and told them everything that we had learned
      from Shadrach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your plan, Sergeant?&rdquo; asked Oliver when he had heard. &ldquo;Tell me,
      for I have none; my head is muddled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This, Captain, for what it is worth; that I should go down through the
      hole that Cat here speaks of, and get into the den. Then when they let
      down the Professor, if they do, and pull up the gates, that I should keep
      back the lions with my rifle while he bolts to the ladder which is ready
      for him, and I follow if I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Capital,&rdquo; said Orme, &ldquo;but you can&rsquo;t go alone. I&rsquo;ll come too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What schemes do you make?&rdquo; asked Maqueda eagerly, for, of course, she
      could not understand our talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, my friend,&rdquo; she said to Oliver reproachfully, &ldquo;would you risk your
      life again to-night? Surely it is tempting the goodness of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be tempting the goodness of God much more if I left my friend to
      be eaten by lions, Lady,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed much discussions. In the end it was agreed that we should
      descend to the level of the den, if this were possible; that Oliver and
      Quick should go down into the den with Japhet, who instantly volunteered
      to accompany them, and that I, with some of the Mountaineers, should stop
      in the mouth of the hole as a reserve to cover their retreat from the
      lions. I pleaded to be allowed to take a more active part, but of this
      they would not hear, saying with some truth, that I was by far the best
      shot of the three, and could do much more to help them from above, if, as
      was hoped, the moon should shine brightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I knew they really meant that I was too old to be of service in such
      an adventure as this. Also they desired to keep me out of risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the question as to who should descend the last tunnel to the
      place of operations. Oliver wished Maqueda to return to the top of the
      cliff and wait there, but she said at once that she could not think of
      attempting the ascent without our aid; also that she was determined to see
      the end of the matter. Even Joshua would not go; I think, that being an
      unpopular character among them, he distrusted the Mountaineers, whose duty
      it would have been to escort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was suggested that he should remain where he was until we returned, if
      we did return, but this idea commended itself to him still less than the
      other. Indeed he pointed out with much truth what we had overlooked,
      namely, that now the Fung knew of the passage and were quite capable of
      playing our own game, that is, of throwing a bridge across from the
      sphinx&rsquo;s tail and attempting the storm of Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then what should I do if they found me here alone?&rdquo; he added
      pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda answered that she was sure she did not know, but that meanwhile it
      might be wise to block the mouth of the tunnel by which we had reached the
      plateau in such a fashion that it could not easily be forced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Oliver, &ldquo;and if we ever get out of this, to blow the shaft
      in and make sure that it cannot be used.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shaft might be useful, Captain,&rdquo; said Quick doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a better way, Sergeant, if we want to mine under the sphinx; I
      mean through the Tomb of Kings. I took the levels roughly, and the end of
      it can&rsquo;t be far off. Anyhow, this shaft is of no more use to us now that
      the Fung have found it out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then we set to work to fill in the mouth of the passage with such loose
      stones as we could find. It was a difficult business, but in the end the
      Mountaineers made a very fair job of it under our direction, piling the
      rocks in such a fashion that they could scarcely be cleared away in any
      short time without the aid of explosives.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this work was going on, Japhet, Shadrach, and the Sergeant in charge
      of him, undertook to explore the last shaft which led down to the level of
      the den. To our relief, just as we had finished building up the hole, they
      returned with the news that now after they had removed a fallen stone or
      two it was quite practicable with the aid of ropes and ladders.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in the same order as before, we commenced its passage, and in about
      half-an-hour, for it was under three hundred feet in depth, arrived safely
      at the foot. Here we found a bat-haunted place like a room that evidently
      had been hollowed out by man. As Shadrach had said, at its eastern
      extremity was a large, oblong boulder, so balanced that if even one person
      pushed on either of its ends it swung around, leaving on each side a
      passage large enough to allow a man to walk through in a crouching
      attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very silently we propped open this primæval door and looked out. Now the
      full moon was up, and her brilliant light had begun to flood the gulf. By
      it we saw a dense shadow, that reached from the ground to three hundred
      feet or so above us. This we knew to be that thrown by the flanks of the
      gigantic sphinx which projected beyond the mountain of stone whereon it
      rested, those flanks whence, according to Shadrach, Higgs would be lowered
      in a food-basket. In this shadow and on either side of it, covering a
      space of quite a hundred yards square, lay the feeding-den, whence arose a
      sickly and horrible odour such as is common to any place frequented by
      cats, mingled with the more pungent smell of decaying flesh.
    </p>
    <p>
      This darksome den was surrounded on three sides by precipices, and on the
      fourth, that toward the east, enclosed by a wall or barrier of rock
      pierced with several gates made of bars of metal, or so we judged by the
      light that flowed through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      From beyond this eastern wall came dreadful sounds of roars, snarls, and
      whimperings. Evidently there the sacred lions had their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only one more thing need be mentioned. On the rock floor almost
      immediately beneath us lay remains which, from their torn clothes and
      hair, we knew must be human. As somebody explained, I think it was
      Shadrach, they were those of the man whom Orme had shot upon the tail of
      the sphinx, and of his companions who had been tilted off the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      For awhile we gazed at this horrible hole in silence. Then Oliver took out
      his watch, which was a repeater, and struck it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higgs told me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that he was to be thrown to the lions two hours
      after moonrise, which is within fifteen minutes or so. Sergeant, I think
      we had better be getting ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Captain,&rdquo; answered Quick; &ldquo;but everything is quite ready, including
      those brutes, to judge by the noise they make, excepting perhaps Samuel
      Quick, who never felt less ready for anything in his life. Now then,
      Pussy, run out that ladder. Here&rsquo;s your rifle, Captain, and six reload
      clips of cartridges, five hollow-nosed bullets in each. You&rsquo;ll never want
      more than that, and it&rsquo;s no use carrying extra weight. In your right-hand
      pocket, Captain, don&rsquo;t forget. I&rsquo;ve the same in mine. Doctor, here&rsquo;s a
      pile for you; laid upon that stone. If you lie there, you&rsquo;ll have a good
      light and rest for your elbow, and at this range ought to make very pretty
      shooting, even in the moonlight. Best keep your pistol on the safe,
      Captain; at least, I&rsquo;m doing so, as we might get a fall, and these
      new-fangled weapons are very hair-triggered. Here&rsquo;s Japhet ready, too, so
      give us your marching orders, sir, and we will go to business; the Doctor
      will translate to Japhet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We descend the ladder,&rdquo; said Orme, &ldquo;and advance about fifty paces into
      the shadow, where we can see without being seen; where also, according to
      Shadrach, the food-basket is let down. There we shall stand and await the
      arrival of this basket. If it contains the Professor, he whom the Fung and
      the Abati know as Black Windows, Japhet, you are to seize him and lead, or
      if necessary carry, him to the ladder, up which some of the mountaineers
      must be ready to help him. Your duty, Sergeant, and mine, also that of the
      Doctor firing from above, will be to keep off the lions as best we can,
      should any lions appear, retreating as we fire. If the brutes get one of
      us he must be left, since it is foolish that both lives should be
      sacrificed needlessly. For the rest, you, Sergeant, and you, Japhet, must
      be guided by circumstances and act upon your own discretion. Do not wait
      for special orders from me which I may not be able to give. Now, come on.
      If we do not return, Adams, you will see the Child of Kings safely up the
      shafts and conduct her to Mur. Good-bye, Lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; answered Maqueda in a brave voice; I could not see her face in
      the darkness. &ldquo;Presently, I am sure, you will return with your brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then Joshua broke in:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not be outdone in courage by these Gentiles,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lacking
      their terrible weapons, I cannot advance into the den, but I will descend
      and guard the foot of the ladder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; answered Orme in an astonished voice, &ldquo;glad to have your
      company, I am sure. Only remember that you must be quick in going up it
      again, since hungry lions are active, and let all take notice that we are
      not responsible for anything that may happen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely you had better stop where you are, my uncle,&rdquo; remarked Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be mocked by you for ever after, my niece. No, I go to face the
      lions,&rdquo; and very slowly he crept through the hole and began to descend the
      ladder. Indeed, when Quick followed after an interval he found him only
      half-way down, and had to hurry his movements by accidentally treading on
      his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute or two later, peeping over the edge, I saw that they were all in
      the den, that is, except Joshua, who had reascended the ladder to the
      height of about six feet, and stood on it face outward, holding to the
      rock on either side with his hands as though he had been crucified.
      Fearing lest he should be seen there, even in the shadow, I suggested to
      Maqueda that she should order him either to go down, or to return, which
      she did vigorously, but without effect. So in the end we left him alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the three had vanished into the shadow of the sphinx, and we
      could see nothing of them. The great round moon rose higher and higher,
      flooding the rest of the charnel-house with light, and, save for an
      occasional roar or whimper from the lions beyond the wall, the silence was
      intense. Now I could make out the metal gates in this wall, and even dark
      and stealthy forms which passed and repassed beyond their bars. Then I
      made out something else also, the figures of men gathering on the top of
      the wall, though whence they came I knew not. By degrees their number
      increased till there were hundreds of them, for the wall was broad as a
      roadway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evidently these were spectators, come to witness the ceremony of
      sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince,&rdquo; I whispered to Joshua, &ldquo;you must get down off the ladder or you
      will betray us all. Nay, it is too late to come up here again, for already
      the moonlight strikes just above your head. Go down, or we will cast the
      ladder loose and let you fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he went down and hid himself among some ferns and bushes where we saw
      no more of him for a while, and, to tell the truth, forgot his existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far, far above us, from the back of the idol I suppose, came a faint sound
      of solemn chanting. It sank, and we heard shouts. Then suddenly it swelled
      again. Now Maqueda, who knelt near me, touched my arm and pointed to the
      shadow which gradually was becoming infiltrated with the moonlight flowing
      into it from either side. I looked, and high in the air, perhaps two
      hundred feet from the ground, saw something dark descending slowly.
      Doubtless it was the basket containing Higgs, and whether by coincidence
      or no, at this moment the lions on the farther side of the wall burst into
      peal upon peal of terrific roaring. Perhaps their sentries watching at the
      gate saw or smelt the familiar basket, and communicated the intelligence
      to their fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly, slowly it descended, till it was within a few feet of the ground,
      when it began to sway backward and forward like a pendulum, at each swing
      covering a wider arc. Presently, when it hung over the edge of the shadow
      that was nearest to us, it was let down with a run and overset, and out of
      it, looking very small in those vast surroundings and that mysterious
      light, rolled the figure of a man. Although at that distance we could see
      little of him, accident assured us of his identity, for as he rolled the
      hat he wore fell from him, and I knew it at once for Higgs&rsquo;s sun-helmet.
      He rose from the ground, limped very slowly and painfully after the
      helmet, picked it up, and proceeded to use it to dust his knees. At this
      moment there was a clanking sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! they lift the gates!&rdquo; murmured Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then followed more sounds, this time of wild beasts raging for their prey,
      and of other human beasts shrieking with excitement on the wall above. The
      Professor turned and saw. For a moment he seemed about to run, then
      changed his mind, clapped the helmet on his head, folded his arms and
      stood still, reminding me in some curious way, perhaps, because of the
      shortness of his thick figure, of a picture I had seen of the great
      Napoleon contemplating a disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe what followed is extremely difficult, for we watched not one
      but several simultaneous scenes. For instance, there were the lions, which
      did not behave as might have been expected. I thought that they would rush
      through the doors and bound upon the victim, but whether it was because
      they had already been fed that afternoon or because they thought that a
      single human being was not worth the trouble, they acted differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the open gates they came, in two indolent yellow lines, male
      lions, female lions, half-grown lions, cub lions that cuffed each other in
      play, in all perhaps fifty or sixty of them. Of these only two or three
      looked towards the Professor, for none of them ran or galloped, while the
      rest spread over the den, some of them vanishing into the shadow at the
      edge of the surrounding cliff where the moonlight could not reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here one of them, at any rate, must have travelled fast enough, for it
      seemed only a few seconds later that we heard a terrific yell beneath us,
      and craning over the rock I saw the Prince Joshua running up the ladder
      more swiftly than ever did any London lamplighter when I was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But quickly as he came, the long, thin, sinuous thing beneath came
      quicker. It reared itself on its hind legs, it stretched up a great paw&mdash;I
      can see the gleaming claws in it now&mdash;and struck or hooked at poor
      Joshua. The paw caught him in the small of the back, and seemed to pin him
      against the ladder. Then it was drawn slowly downward, and heaven! how
      Joshua howled. Up came the other paw to repeat the operation, when,
      stretching myself outward and downward, with an Abati holding me by the
      ankles, I managed to shoot the beast through the head so that it fell all
      of a heap, taking with it a large portion of Joshua&rsquo;s nether garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few seconds later he was among us, and tumbled groaning into a corner,
      where he lay in charge of some of the mountaineers, for I had no time to
      attend to him just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the smoke cleared at length, I saw that Japhet had reached Higgs, and
      was gesticulating to him to run, while two lions, a male and a female,
      stood at a little distance, regarding the pair in an interested fashion.
      Higgs, after some brief words of explanation, pointed to his knee.
      Evidently he was lamed and could not run. Japhet, rising to the occasion,
      pointed to his back, and bent down. Higgs flung himself upon it, and was
      hitched up like a sack of flour. The pair began to advance toward the
      ladder, Japhet carrying Higgs as one schoolboy carries another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lion sat down like a great dog, watching this strange proceeding with
      mild interest, but the lioness, filled with feminine curiosity, followed
      sniffing at Higgs, who looked over his shoulder. Taking off his battered
      helmet, he threw it at the beast, hitting her on the head. She growled,
      then seized the helmet, playing with it for a moment as a kitten does with
      a ball of wool, and next instant, finding it unsatisfying, uttered a short
      and savage roar, ran forward, and crouched to spring, lashing her tail. I
      could not fire, because a bullet that would hit her must first pass
      through Japhet and Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, just when I thought that the end had come, a rifle went off in the
      shadow and she rolled over, kicking and biting the rock. Thereon the
      indolent male lion seemed to awake, and sprang, not at the men, but at the
      wounded lioness, and a hellish fight ensued, of which the details and end
      were lost in a mist of dust and flying hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd upon the wall, becoming alive to the real situation, began to
      scream in indignant excitement which quickly communicated itself to the
      less savage beasts. These set up a terrible roaring, and ran about,
      keeping for the most part to the shadows, while Japhet and his burden made
      slow but steady progress toward the ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then from the gloom beneath the hind-quarters of the sphinx rose a sound
      of rapid firing, and presently Orme and Quick emerged into the moonlight,
      followed by a number of angry lions that advanced in short rushes.
      Evidently the pair had kept their heads, and were acting on a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them emptied his rifle at the pursuing beasts, while the other ran
      back a few paces, thrusting in a fresh clip of cartridges as he went. Then
      he began to fire, and his companion in turn retreated behind him. In this
      way they knocked over a number of lions, for the range was too short for
      them to miss often, and the expanding bullets did their work very well,
      paralyzing even when they did not kill. I also opened fire over their
      heads, and, although in that uncertain light the majority of my shots did
      no damage, the others disposed of several animals which I saw were
      becoming dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      So things went on until all four, that is, Japhet with Higgs upon his
      back, and Orme and Quick, were within twenty paces of the ladder, although
      separated from each other by perhaps half the length of a cricket pitch.
      We thought that they were safe, and shouted in our joy, while the hundreds
      of spectators on the wall who fortunately dared not descend into the den
      because of the lions, which are undiscriminating beasts, yelled with rage
      at the imminent rescue of the sacrifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then of a sudden the position changed. From every quarter fresh lions
      seemed to arrive, ringing the men round and clearly bent on slaughter,
      although the shouting and the sound of firearms, which they had never
      heard before, frightened them and made them cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      A half-grown cub rushed in and knocked over Japhet and Higgs. I fired and
      hit it in the flank. It bit savagely at its wound, then sprang on to the
      prostrate pair, and stood over them growling, but in such pain that it
      forgot to kill them. The ring of beasts closed in&mdash;we could see their
      yellow eyes glowing in the gloom. Orme and Quick might have got through by
      the help of their rifles, but they could not leave the others. The
      dreadful climax seemed at hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said Maqueda, who all this while had watched panting at my
      side, and rose to run to the ladder. I thrust her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; I shouted. &ldquo;Follow me, Abati! Shall a woman lead you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of how I descended that ladder I have no recollection, nor do I in the
      least know how the Mountaineers came after me, but I think that the most
      of them rolled and scrambled down the thirty feet of rock. At least, to
      their honour be it said, they did come, yelling like demons and waving
      long knives in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of our sudden arrival from above was extraordinary. Scared by
      the rush and the noise, the lions gave way, then bolted in every
      direction, the wounded cub, which could not, or would not move, being
      stabbed to death where it stood over Higgs and Japhet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes more and all of us were safe in the mouth of the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was how we rescued Higgs from the den of the sacred lions which
      guarded the idol of the Fung.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE ADVENTURES OF HIGGS
    </h3>
    <p>
      A more weary and dishevelled set of people than that which about the hour
      of dawn finally emerged from the mouth of the ancient shaft on to the
      cliffs of Mur it has seldom been my lot to behold. Yet with a single
      exception the party was a happy one, for we had come triumphant through
      great dangers, and actually effected our object&mdash;the rescue of Higgs,
      which, under the circumstances most people would have thought impossible.
      Yes, there he was in the flesh before us, having injured his knee and lost
      his hat, but otherwise quite sound save for a few trifling scratches
      inflicted by the cub, and still wearing what the natives called his &ldquo;black
      windows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even the Prince Joshua was happy, though wrapped in a piece of coarse
      sacking because the lion had taken most of his posterior clothing, and
      terribly sore from the deep cuts left by the claws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he not dared the dangers of the den, and thus proved himself a hero
      whose fame would last for generations? Had I not assured him that his
      honourable wounds, though painful (as a matter of fact, after they had
      set, they kept him stiff as a mummy for some days, so that unless he stood
      upon his feet, he had to be carried, or lie rigid on his face) would
      probably not prove fatal? And had he not actually survived to reach the
      upper air again, which was more than he ever expected to do? No wonder
      that he was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I alone could not share in the general joy, since, although my friend was
      restored to me, my son still remained a prisoner among the Fung. Yet even
      in this matter things might have been worse, since I learned that he was
      well treated, and in no danger. But of that I will write presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never shall I forget the scene after the arrival of Higgs in our hole,
      when the swinging boulder had been closed and made secure and the lamps
      lighted. There he sat on the floor, his red hair glowing like a torch, his
      clothes torn and bloody, his beard ragged and stretching in a Newgate
      frill to his ears. Indeed, his whole appearance, accentuated by the blue
      spectacles with wire gauze side-pieces, was more disreputable than words
      can tell; moreover, he smelt horribly of lion. He put his hand into his
      pocket, and produced his big pipe, which had remained unbroken in its
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some tobacco, please,&rdquo; he said. (Those were his first words to us!) &ldquo;I
      have finished mine, saved up the last to smoke just before they put me
      into that stinking basket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I gave him some, and as he lit his pipe the light of the match fell upon
      the face of Maqueda, who was staring at him with amused astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an uncommonly pretty woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she doing down here,
      and who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I told him, whereon he rose, or rather tried to, felt for his hat, which,
      of course, had gone, with the idea of taking it off, and instantly
      addressed her in his beautiful and fluent Arabic, saying how glad he was
      to have this unexpected honour, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      She congratulated him on his escape, whereon his face grew serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a nasty business,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;as yet I can hardly remember whether my
      name is Daniel, or Ptolemy Higgs.&rdquo; Then he turned to us and added, &ldquo;Look
      here, you fellows, if I don&rsquo;t thank you it isn&rsquo;t because I am not
      grateful, but because I can&rsquo;t. The truth is, I&rsquo;m a bit dazed. Your son is
      all right, Adams; he&rsquo;s a good fellow, and we grew great friends. Safe? Oh!
      yes, he&rsquo;s safe as a church! Old Barung, he&rsquo;s the Sultan, and another good
      fellow, although he did throw me to the lions&mdash;because the priests
      made him&mdash;is very fond of him, and is going to marry him to his
      daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the men announced that everything was ready for our ascent,
      and when I had attended to Joshua with a heart made thankful by Higgs&rsquo;s
      news, we began that toilsome business, and, as I have already said, at
      length accomplished it safely. But even then our labours were not ended,
      since it was necessary to fill up the mouth of the shaft so as to make it
      impossible that it should be used by the Fung, who now knew of its
      existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this a business that could be delayed, for as we passed the
      plateau whence Oliver and Japhet had crossed to the sphinx, we heard the
      voices of men on the farther side of the rough wall that we had built
      there. Evidently the priests, or idol guards, infuriated by the rescue of
      their victim, had already managed to bridge the gulf and were
      contemplating assault, a knowledge which caused us to hurry our movements
      considerably. If they had got through before we passed them, our fate
      would have been terrible, since at the best we must have slowly starved in
      the pit below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, as soon as we reached the top and had blocked it temporarily,
      Quick, weary as he was, was sent off on horseback, accompanied by Maqueda,
      Shadrach, now under the terms of his contract once more a free man, and
      two Mountaineers, to gallop to the palace of Mur, and fetch a supply of
      explosives. The rest of us, for Higgs declined to leave, and we had no
      means of carrying Joshua, remained watching the place, or rather the Abati
      watched while we slept with our rifles in our hands. Before noon Quick
      returned, accompanied by many men with litters and all things needful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we pulled out the stones, and Oliver, Japhet, and some others
      descended to the first level and arranged blasting charges. Awhile after
      he reappeared with his companions, looking somewhat pale and anxious, and
      shouted to us to get back. Following our retreat to a certain distance,
      unwinding a wire as he came, presently he stopped and pressed the button
      of a battery which he held in his hand. There was a muffled explosion and
      a tremor of the soil like to that of an earthquake, while from the mouth
      of the shaft stones leapt into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was over, and all that could be noted was a sinkage in the ground where
      the ancient pit had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry for them,&rdquo; said Oliver presently, &ldquo;but it had to be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry for whom?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For those Fung priests or soldiers. The levels below are full of them,
      dead or alive. They were pouring up at our heels. Well, no one will travel
      that road again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, in the guest house at Mur, Higgs told us his story. After his
      betrayal by Shadrach, which, it appeared, was meant to include us all, for
      the Professor overheard the hurried talk between him and a Fung captain,
      he was seized and imprisoned in the body of the great sphinx, where many
      chambers and dungeons had been hollowed out by the primæval race that
      fashioned it. Here Barung the Sultan visited him and informed him of his
      meeting with the rest of us, to whom apparently he had taken a great
      liking, and also that we had refused to purchase a chance of his release
      at the price of being false to our trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said Higgs, &ldquo;that when first I heard this I was very angry
      with you, and thought you a set of beasts. But on considering things I saw
      the other side of it, and that you were right, although I never could come
      to fancy the idea of being sacrificed to a sphinx by being chucked like a
      piece of horse-flesh to a lot of holy lions. However, Barung, an excellent
      fellow in his way, assured me that there was no road out of the matter
      without giving grave offence to the priests, who are very powerful among
      the Fung, and bringing a fearful curse on the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanwhile, he made me as comfortable as he could. For instance, I was
      allowed to walk upon the back of the idol, to associate with the priests,
      a suspicious and most exclusive set, and to study their entire religious
      system, from which I have no doubt that of Egypt was derived. Indeed, I
      have made a great discovery which, if ever we get out of this, will carry
      my name down to all generations. The forefathers of these Fung were
      undoubtedly also the forefathers of the pre-dynastic Egyptians, as is
      shown by the similarity of their customs and spiritual theories. Further,
      intercourse was kept up between the Fung, who then had their headquarters
      here in Mur, and the Egyptians in the time of the ancient empire, till the
      Twentieth Dynasty, indeed, if not later. My friends, in the dungeons in
      which I was confined there is an inscription, or, rather, a <i>graffite</i>,
      made by a prisoner extradited to Mur by Rameses II., after twenty years&rsquo; 
      residence in Egypt, which was written by him on the night before he was
      thrown to the sacred lions, that even in those days were an established
      institution. And I have got a copy of that inscription in my pocket-book.
      I tell you,&rdquo; he added in a scream of triumph, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a certified copy
      of that inscription, thanks to Shadrach, on whose dirty head be
      blessings!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I congratulated him heartily upon this triumph, and before he proceeded to
      give us further archæological details, asked him for some information
      about my boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Higgs, &ldquo;he is a very nice young man and extremely good looking.
      Indeed, I am quite proud to have such a godson. He was much interested to
      hear that you were hunting for him after so many years, quite touched
      indeed. He still talks English, though with a Fung accent, and, of course,
      would like to escape. Meanwhile, he is having a very good time, being
      chief singer to the god, for his voice is really beautiful, an office
      which carries with it all sorts of privileges. I told you, didn&rsquo;t I, that
      he is to be married to Barung&rsquo;s only legitimate daughter on the night of
      the next full moon but one. The ceremony is to take place in Harmac City,
      and will be the greatest of its sort for generations, a feast of the
      entire people in short. I should very much like to be present at it, but
      being an intelligent young man he has promised to keep notes of
      everything, which I hope may become available in due course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is he attached to this savage lady?&rdquo; I asked dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Attached? Oh, dear no, I think he said he had never seen her, and only
      knew that she was rather plain and reported to possess a haughty temper.
      He is a philosophical young man, however, as might be expected from one
      who has undergone so many vicissitudes, and, therefore, takes things as
      they come, thanking heaven that they are no worse. You see, as the husband
      of the Sultan&rsquo;s daughter, unless the pair quarrel very violently, he will
      be safe from the lions, and he could never quite say as much before. But
      we didn&rsquo;t go into these domestic matters very deeply as there were so many
      more important things to interest us both. He wanted to know all about you
      and our plans, and naturally I wanted to know all about the Fung and the
      ritual and traditions connected with the worship of Harmac, so that we
      were never dull for a single moment. In fact, I wish that we could have
      had longer together, for we became excellent friends. But whatever
      happens, I think that I have collected the cream of his information,&rdquo; and
      he tapped a fat note-book in his hands, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an awful thing it would have been if a lion had eaten this. For
      myself it did not matter; there may be many better Egyptologists, but I
      doubt if any one of them will again have such opportunities of original
      research. However, I took every possible precaution to save my notes by
      leaving a copy of the most important of them written with native ink upon
      sheepskin in charge of your son. Indeed, I meant to leave the originals
      also, but fortunately forgot in the excitement of my very hurried
      departure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I agreed with him that his chances had been unique and that he was a most
      lucky archæologist, and presently he went on puffing at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, when Oliver turned up in that unexpected fashion on the back
      of the idol, remembering your wishes and natural desire to recover your
      son, I did my best to rescue him also. But he wasn&rsquo;t in the room beneath,
      where I thought I should find him. The priests were there instead, and
      they had heard us talking above, and you know the rest. Well, as it
      happens, it didn&rsquo;t matter, though that descent into the den of lions&mdash;there
      were two or three hundred feet of it, and the rope seemed worn uncommonly
      thin with use&mdash;was a trying business to the nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you think about all the time?&rdquo; asked Oliver curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think about? I didn&rsquo;t think much, was in too great a fright. I just
      wondered whether St. Paul had the same sensations when he was let down in
      a basket; wondered what the early Christian martyrs felt like in the
      arena; wondered whether Barung, with whom my parting was quite
      affectionate, would come in the morning and look for me as Darius did for
      Daniel and how much he would find if he did; hoped that my specs would
      give one of those brutes appendicitis, and so forth. My word! it was
      sickening, especially that kind of school-treat swing and bump at the end.
      I never could bear swinging. Still, it was all for the best, as I
      shouldn&rsquo;t have gone a yard along that sphinx&rsquo;s tail without tumbling off,
      tight-rope walking not being in my line; and I&rsquo;ll tell you what, you are
      just the best three fellows in the whole world. Don&rsquo;t you think I forget
      that because I haven&rsquo;t said much. And now let&rsquo;s have your yarn, for I want
      to hear how things stand, which I never expected to do this side of
      Judgment-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we told him all, while he listened open-mouthed. When we came to the
      description of the Tomb of the Kings his excitement could scarcely be
      restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t touched them,&rdquo; he almost screamed; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t say you have been
      vandals enough to touch them, for every article must be catalogued <i>in
      situ</i> and drawings must be made. If possible, specimen groups with
      their surrounding offerings should be moved so that they can be set up
      again in museums. Why, there&rsquo;s six months&rsquo; work before me, at least. And
      to think that if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you, by now I should be in process of
      digestion by a lion, a stinking, mangy, sacred lion!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning I was awakened by Higgs limping into my room in some weird
      sleeping-suit that he had contrived with the help of Quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell me some more about that girl, Walda
      Nagasta. What a sweet face she&rsquo;s got, and what pluck! Of course, such
      things ain&rsquo;t in my line, never looked at a woman these twenty years past,
      hard enough to remember her next morning, but, by Jingo! the eyes of that
      one made me feel quite queer here,&rdquo; and he hit the sleeping-suit somewhere
      in the middle, &ldquo;though perhaps it was only because she was such a contrast
      to the lions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; I answered in a solemn voice, &ldquo;let me tell you that she is more
      dangerous to meddle with than any lion, and what&rsquo;s more, if you don&rsquo;t want
      to further complicate matters with a flaming row, you had better keep to
      your old habits and leave her eyes alone. I mean that Oliver is in love
      with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is. I never expected anything else, but what&rsquo;s that got to
      do with it? Why shouldn&rsquo;t I be in love with her too? Though I admit,&rdquo; he
      added sadly, contemplating his rotund form, &ldquo;the chances are in his
      favour, especially as he&rsquo;s got the start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are, Ptolemy, for she&rsquo;s in love with him,&rdquo; and I told him what we
      had seen in the Tomb of Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      First he roared with laughter, then on second thoughts grew exceedingly
      indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it scandalous of Oliver, compromising us all in this way&mdash;the
      lucky dog! These selfish, amorous adventures will let us in for no end of
      trouble. It is even probably, Adams, that you and I may come to a
      miserable end, solely because of this young man&rsquo;s erotic tendencies. Just
      fancy neglecting business in order to run after a pretty, round-faced
      Jewess, that is if she <i>is</i> a Jewess, which I doubt, as the blood
      must have got considerably mixed by now, and the first Queen of Sheba, if
      she ever existed, was an Ethiopian. As a friend almost old enough to be
      his father, I shall speak to him very seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I called after him as he hobbled off to take his bath, &ldquo;only
      if you are wise, you won&rsquo;t speak to Maqueda, for she might misinterpret
      your motives if you go on staring at her as you did yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That morning I was summoned to see the Prince Joshua and dress his wounds,
      which, although not of a serious nature, were very painful. The moment
      that I entered the man&rsquo;s presence I noticed a change in his face. Like the
      rest of us I had always set this fellow down as a mere poltroon and
      windbag, a blower of his own trumpet, as Oliver had called him. Now I got
      an insight into his real nature which showed me that although he might be
      these things and worse, he was also a very determined and dangerous
      person, animated by ambitions which he meant to satisfy at all hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I had done what I could for him and told him that in my opinion he
      had no ill results to fear from his hurts, since the thick clothes he was
      wearing at the time had probably cleaned the lion&rsquo;s paws of any poison
      that might have been on them, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Physician, I desire private words with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I bowed, and he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Child of Kings, hereditary ruler of this land, somewhat against the
      advice of her Council, has thought fit to employ you and your Gentile
      companions in order that by your skill and certain arts of which you are
      masters you may damage its ancient enemies, the Fung, and in reward has
      promised to pay you well should you succeed in your endeavours. Now, I
      wish you to understand that though you think yourselves great men, and may
      for aught I know be great in your own country, here you are but servants
      like any other mercenaries whom it may please us to hire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His tone was so offensive that, though it might have been wiser to keep
      silent, I could not help interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You use hard words, Prince,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;let me then explain what is the
      real pay for which we work and undergo some risks. Mine is the hope of
      recovering a son who is the slave of your enemies. That of the Captain
      Orme is the quest of adventure and war, since being a rich man in his own
      country he needs no further wealth. That of him whom you call Black
      Windows, but whose name is Higgs, is the pure love of learning. In England
      and throughout the West he is noted for his knowledge of dead peoples,
      their languages, and customs, and it is to study these that he has
      undertaken so terrible a journey. As for Quick, he is Orme&rsquo;s man, who has
      known him from childhood, an old soldier who has served with him in war
      and comes hither to be with the master whom he loves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Joshua, &ldquo;a servant, a person of no degree, who yet dares to
      threaten me, the premier prince of the Abati, to my face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the presence of death all men are equal, Prince. You acted in a
      fashion that might have brought his lord, who was daring a desperate deed,
      to a hideous doom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what do I care about his lord&rsquo;s desperate deeds, Physician? I see
      that you set store by such things, and think those who accomplish them
      great and wonderful. Well, we do not. There is no savage among the
      barbarous Fung would not do all that your Orme does, and more, just
      because he is a savage. We who are civilized, we who are cultivated, we
      who are wise, know better. Our lives were given us to enjoy, not to throw
      away or to lose at the sword&rsquo;s point, and, therefore, no doubt, you would
      call us cowards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet, Prince, those who bear that title of coward which you hold one of
      honour, are apt to perish &lsquo;at the sword&rsquo;s point.&rsquo; The Fung wait without
      your gates, O Prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And therefore, O Gentile, we hire you to fight the Fung. Still, I bear no
      grudge against your servant, Quick, who is himself but a white-skinned
      Fung, for he acted according to his nature, and I forgive him; only in the
      future let him beware! And now&mdash;for a greater matter. The Child of
      Kings is beautiful, she is young and high spirited; a new face from
      another land may perchance touch her fancy. But,&rdquo; he added meaningly, &ldquo;let
      the owner of that face remember who she is and what he is; let him
      remember that for any outside the circle of the ancient blood to lift his
      eyes to the daughter of Solomon is to earn death, death slow and cruel for
      himself and all who aid and abet him. Let him remember, lastly, that this
      high-born lady to whom he, an unknown and vagrant Gentile, dares to talk
      as equal to equal, has from childhood been my affianced, who will shortly
      be my wife, although it may please her to seem to flout me after the
      fashion of maidens, and that we Abati are jealous of the honour of our
      women. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Prince,&rdquo; I answered, for by now my temper was roused. &ldquo;But I would
      have you understand something also&mdash;that we are men of a high race
      whose arm stretches over half the world, and that we differ from the
      little tribe of the Abati, whose fame is not known to us, in this&mdash;that
      we are jealous of our own honour, and do not need to hire strangers to
      fight the foes we fear to face. Next time I come to attend to your wounds,
      O Prince, I trust that they will be in front, and not behind. One word
      more, if you will be advised by me you will not threaten that Captain whom
      you call a Gentile and a mercenary, lest you should learn that it is not
      always well to be a coward, of blood however ancient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then, in a towering rage, I left him, feeling that I had made a thorough
      fool of myself. But the truth was that I could not sit still and hear men
      such as my companions, to say nothing of myself, spoken of thus by a
      bloated cur, who called himself a prince and boasted of his own
      poltroonery. He glowered at me as I went, and the men of his party who
      hung about the end of the great room and in his courts, glowered at me
      also. Clearly he was a very dangerous cur, and I almost wished that
      instead of threatening to slap his face down in the tunnel, Quick had
      broken his neck and made an end of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So did the others when I told them the story, although I think it opened
      their eyes, and especially those of Oliver, to the grave and growing
      dangers of the situation. Afterward he informed me that he had spoken of
      the matter with Maqueda, and that she was much frightened for our sakes,
      and somewhat for her own. Joshua, she said, was a man capable of any
      crime, who had at his back the great majority of the Abati; a jealous,
      mean and intolerant race who made up in cunning for what they lacked in
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as I saw well, the peril of their situation did nothing to separate
      this pair or to lessen their love. Indeed, rather did it seem to bind them
      closer together, and to make them more completely one. In short, the
      tragedy took its appointed course, whilst we stood by and watched it
      helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the afternoon of my angry interview with Joshua we were summoned to a
      meeting of the Council, whither we went, not without some trepidation,
      expecting trouble. Trouble there was, but of a different sort to that
      which we feared. Scarcely had we entered the great room where the Child of
      Kings was seated in her chair of state surrounded by all the pomp and
      ceremony of her mimic court, when the big doors at the end of it were
      opened, and through them marched three gray-bearded men in white robes
      whom we saw at once were heralds or ambassadors from the Fung. These men
      bowed to the veiled Maqueda and, turning toward where we stood in a little
      group apart, bowed to us also.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of Joshua, who was there supported by two servants, for he could not
      yet stand alone, and the other notables and priests of the Abati, they
      took not the slightest heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; answered the spokesman of the embassy, &ldquo;we are sent by our Sultan,
      Barung, son of Barung, Ruler of the Fung nation. These are the words of
      Barung: O Walda Nagasta! &lsquo;By the hands and the wit of the white lords whom
      you have called to your aid, you have of late done much evil to the god
      Harmac and to me his servant. You have destroyed one of the gates of my
      city, and with it many of my people. You have rescued a prisoner out of my
      hands, robbing Harmac of his sacrifice and thereby bringing his wrath upon
      us. You have slain sundry of the sacred beasts that are the mouth of
      sacrifice, you have killed certain of the priests and guards of Harmac in
      a hole of the rocks. Moreover my spies tell me that you plan further ills
      against the god and against me. Now I send to tell you that for these and
      other offences I will make an end of the people of the Abati, whom
      hitherto I have spared. In a little while I marry my daughter to the white
      man, that priest of Harmac who is called Singer of Egypt, and who is said
      to be the son of the physician in your service, but after I have
      celebrated this feast and my people have finished the hoeing of their
      crops, I take up the sword in earnest, nor will I lay it down again until
      the Abati are no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Learn that last night after the holy beasts had been slain and the
      sacrifice snatched away, the god Harmac spoke to his priests in prophecy.
      And this was his prophecy; that before the gathering in of the harvest his
      <i>head</i> should sleep above the plain of Mur. We know not the
      interpretation of the saying, but this I know, that before the gathering
      of the harvest I, or those who rule after me, will lie down to sleep
      within my city of Mur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, choose&mdash;surrender forthwith and, save for the dog, Joshua, who
      the other day tried to entrap me against the custom of peoples, and ten
      others whom I shall name, I will spare the lives of all of you, though
      Joshua and these ten I will hang, since they are not worthy to die by the
      sword. Or resist, and by Harmac himself I swear that every man among the
      Abati shall die save the white lords whom I honour because they are brave,
      and that servant of yours who stood with them last night in the den of
      lions, and that every woman shall be made a slave, save you, O Walda
      Nagasta, because of your great heart. Your answer, O Lady of the Abati!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Maqueda looked around the faces of her Council, and saw fear written
      upon them all. Indeed, as we noted, many of them shook in their terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My answer will be short, ambassadors of Barung,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;still, I
      am but one woman, and it is fitting that those who represent the people
      should speak for the people. My uncle, Joshua, you are the first of my
      Council, what have you to say? Are you willing to give up your life with
      ten others whose names I do not know, that there may be peace between us
      and the Fung?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; answered Joshua, with a splutter of rage, &ldquo;do I live to hear a
      Walda Nagasta suggest that the first prince of the land, her uncle and
      affianced husband, should be surrendered to our hereditary foes to be
      hanged like a worn-out hound, and do you, O unknown ten, who doubtless
      stand in this chamber, live to hear it also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My uncle, you do not. I asked if such was your wish, that is all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I answer that it is not my wish, nor the wish of the ten, nor the
      wish of the Abati. Nay, we will fight the Fung and destroy them, and of
      their beast-headed idol Harmac we will make blocks to build our synagogues
      and stones to pave our roads. Do you hear, savages of Fung?&rdquo; and assisted
      by his two servants he hobbled towards them, grinning in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      The envoys looked him up and down with their quiet eyes. &ldquo;We hear and we
      are very glad to hear,&rdquo; their spokesman answered, &ldquo;since we Fung love to
      settle our quarrels with the sword and not by treaty. But to you, Joshua,
      we say: Make haste to die before we enter Mur, since the rope is not the
      only means of death whereof we know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very solemnly the three ambassadors saluted, first the Child of Kings and
      next ourselves, then turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill them!&rdquo; shouted Joshua, &ldquo;they have threatened and insulted me, the
      Prince!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But no one lifted a hand against the men, who passed safely out of the
      palace to the square, where an escort waited with their horses.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HOW PHARAOH MET SHADRACH
    </h3>
    <p>
      When the ambassadors had gone, at first there was silence, a very heavy
      silence, since even the frivolous Abati felt that the hour was big with
      fate. Of a sudden, however, the members of the Council began to chatter
      like so many monkeys, each talking without listening to what his neighbour
      said, till at length a gorgeously dressed person, I understood that he was
      a priest, stepped forward, and shouted down the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke in an excited and venomous fashion. He pointed out that we
      Gentiles had brought all this trouble upon Mur, since before we came the
      Abati, although threatened, had lived in peace and glory&mdash;he actually
      used the word glory!&mdash;for generations. But now we had stung the Fung,
      as a hornet stings a bull, and made them mad, so that they wished to toss
      the Abati. He proposed, therefore, that we should at once be ejected from
      Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point I saw Joshua whisper into the ear of a man, who called out:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, for then they would go to their friend, Barung, a savage like
      themselves, and having learned our secrets, would doubtless use them
      against us. I say that they must be killed instantly,&rdquo; and he drew a
      sword, and waved it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quick walked up to the fellow and clapped a pistol to his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drop that sword,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or <i>you</i>&rsquo;ll never hear the end of the
      story,&rdquo; and he obeyed, whereupon Quick came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Maqueda began to speak, quietly enough, although I could see that she
      was quaking with passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These men are our guests,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;come hither to serve us. Do you
      desire to murder our guests? Moreover, of what use would that be? One
      thing alone can save us, the destruction of the god of the Fung, since,
      according to the ancient saying of that people, when the idol is destroyed
      the Fung will leave their city of Harmac. Moreover, as to this new
      prophecy of the priests of the idol, that before the gathering in of the
      harvest his head shall sleep above the plain of Mur, how can that happen
      if it is destroyed, unless indeed it means that Harmac shall sleep in the
      heavens. Therefore what have you to fear from threats built upon that
      which cannot happen?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can <i>you</i> destroy this false god Harmac, or dare <i>you</i>
      fight the Fung? You know that it is not so, for had it been so what need
      was there for me to send for these Westerns? And if you murder them, will
      Barung thereby be appeased? Nay, I tell you that being a brave and
      honourable man, although our enemy, he will become ten times more wroth
      with you than he was before, and exact a vengeance even more terrible. I
      tell you also, that then you must find another Walda Nagasta to rule over
      you, since I, Maqueda, will do so no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; said some one, &ldquo;you are the last woman of the true
      blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you can choose one of blood that is not true, or elect a king, as
      the Jews elected Saul, for if my guests are butchered I shall die of very
      shame.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words of hers seemed to cow the Council, one of whom asked what
      would she have them do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&rdquo; she replied, throwing back her veil, &ldquo;why, be men, raise an army of
      every male who can carry a sword; help the foreigners, and they will lead
      you to victory. People of the Abati, would you be slaughtered, would you
      see your women slaves, and your ancient name blotted out from the list of
      peoples?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now some of them cried, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then save yourselves. You are still many, the strangers here have skill
      in war, they can lead if you will follow. Be brave a while, and I swear to
      you that by harvest the Abati shall sit in the city of Harmac and not the
      Fung in Mur. I have spoken, now do what you will,&rdquo; and rising from her
      chair of state Maqueda left the chamber, motioning to us to do likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The end of all this business was that a peace was made between us and the
      Council of the Abati. After their pompous, pedantic fashion they swore
      solemnly on the roll of the Law that they would aid us in every way to
      overcome the Fung, and even obey such military orders as we might give
      them, subject to the confirmation of these orders by a small council of
      their generals. In short, being very frightened, for a time they forgot
      their hatred of us foreigners.
    </p>
    <p>
      So a scheme of operations was agreed upon, and some law passed by the
      Council, the only governing body among the Abati, for they possessed no
      representative institutions, under which law a kind of conscription was
      established for a while. Let me say at once that it met with the most
      intense opposition. The Abati were agriculturalists who loathed military
      service. From their childhood they had heard of the imminence of invasion,
      but no actual invasion had ever yet taken place. The Fung were always
      without, and they were always within, an inland isle, the wall of rock
      that they thought impassable being their sea which protected them from
      danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had no experience of slaughter and rapine, their imaginations were
      not sufficiently strong to enable them to understand what these things
      meant; they were lost in the pettiness of daily life and its pressing
      local interests. Their homes in flames, they themselves massacred, their
      women and children dragged off to be the slaves of the victors, a poor
      remnant left to die of starvation among the wasted fields or to become
      wild men of the rocks! All these things they looked upon as a mere tale, a
      romance such as their local poets repeated in the evenings of a wet
      season, dim and far-off events which might have happened to the Canaanites
      and Jebusites and Amalekites in the ancient days whereof the book of their
      Law told them, but which could never happen to <i>them</i>, the
      comfortable Abati. In that book the Israelites always conquered in the
      end, although the Philistines, alias Fung, sat at their gates. For it will
      be remembered that it includes no account of the final fall of Jerusalem
      and awful destruction of its citizens, of which they had little if any
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it came about that our recruiting parties, perhaps press gangs would be
      a better term, were not well received. I know it, for this branch of the
      business was handed over to me, of course as adviser to the Abati
      captains, and on several occasions, when riding round the villages on the
      shores of their beautiful lake, we were met by showers of stones, and were
      even the object of active attacks which had to be put down with bloodshed.
      Still, an army of five or six thousand men was got together somehow, and
      formed into camps, whence desertions were incessant, once or twice
      accompanied by the murder of officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s &lsquo;opeless, downright &lsquo;opeless, Doctor,&rdquo; said Quick to me, dropping
      his h&rsquo;s, as he sometimes did in the excitement of the moment. &ldquo;What can
      one do with a crowd of pigs, everyone of them bent on bolting to his own
      sty, or anywhere except toward the enemy? The sooner the Fung get them the
      better for all concerned, say I, and if it wasn&rsquo;t for our Lady yonder&rdquo;
       (Quick always called Maqueda after &ldquo;our Lady,&rdquo; after it had been impressed
      upon him that &ldquo;her Majesty&rdquo; was an incorrect title), &ldquo;my advice to the
      Captain and you gentlemen would be: Get out of this infernal hole as quick
      as your legs can carry you, and let&rsquo;s do a bit of hunting on the way home,
      leaving the Abati to settle their own affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget, Sergeant, that I have a reason for staying in this part of
      the world, and so perhaps have the others. For instance, the Professor is
      very fond of those old skeletons down in the cave,&rdquo; and I paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Doctor, and the Captain is very fond of something much better than a
      skeleton, and so are we all. Well, we&rsquo;ve got to see it through, but
      somehow I don&rsquo;t think that every one of us will have that luck, though
      it&rsquo;s true that when a man has lived fairly straight according to his
      lights a few years more or less don&rsquo;t matter much one way or the other.
      After all, except you gentlemen, who is there that will miss Samuel
      Quick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then without waiting for an answer, drawing himself up straight as a
      ramrod he marched off to assist some popinjays of Abati officers, whom he
      hated and who hated him, to instil the elements of drill into a newly
      raised company, leaving me to wonder what fears or premonitions filled his
      honest soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not Quick&rsquo;s principal work, since for at least six hours of
      every day he was engaged in helping Oliver in our great enterprise of
      driving a tunnel from the end of the Tomb of Kings deep into the solid
      rock that formed the base of the mighty idol of the Fung. The task was
      stupendous, and would indeed have been impossible had not Orme&rsquo;s
      conjecture that some passage had once run from the extremity of the cave
      toward the idol proved to be perfectly accurate. Such a passage indeed was
      found walled up at the back of the chair containing the bones of the
      hunchbacked king. It descended very sharply for a distance of several
      hundred yards, after which for another hundred yards or more its walls and
      roof were so riven and shaky that, for fear of accidents, we found it
      necessary to timber them as we went.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we came to a place where they had fallen in altogether, shaken
      down, I presume, by the great earthquake which had destroyed so much of
      the ancient cave-city. At this spot, if Oliver&rsquo;s instruments and
      calculations could be trusted, we were within about two hundred feet of
      the floor of the den of lions, to which it seemed probable that the
      passage once led, and of course the question arose as to what should be
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Council was held to discuss this problem, at which Maqueda and a few of
      the Abati notables were present. To these Oliver explained that even if
      that were possible it would be useless to clear out the old passage and at
      the end find ourselves once more in the den of lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, is your plan?&rdquo; asked Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I, your servant, am instructed to attempt to destroy
      the idol Harmac, by means of the explosives which we have brought with us
      from England. First, I would ask you if you still cling to that design?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should it be abandoned?&rdquo; inquired Maqueda. &ldquo;What have you against
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two things, Lady. As an act of war the deed seems useless, since
      supposing that the sphinx is shattered and a certain number of priests and
      guards are destroyed, how will that advance your cause? Secondly, such
      destruction will be very difficult, if it can be done at all. The stuff we
      have with us, it is true, is of fearful strength, yet who can be sure that
      there is enough of it to move this mountain of hard rock, of which I
      cannot calculate the weight, not having the measurements or any knowledge
      of the size of the cavities within its bulk. Lastly, if the attempt is to
      be made, a tunnel must be hollowed of not less than three hundred feet in
      length, first downward and then upward into the very base of the idol, and
      if this is to be done within six weeks, that is, by the night of the
      marriage of the daughter of Barung, the work will be very hard, if indeed
      it can be completed at all, although hundreds of men labour day and
      night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Maqueda thought a while, then looked up and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, you are brave and skilful, tell us all your mind. If you sat in
      my place, what would you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady, I would lead out every able-bodied man and attack the city of the
      Fung, say, on the night of the great festival when they are off their
      guard. I would blow in the gates of the city of Harmac, and storm it and
      drive away the Fung, and afterwards take possession of the idol, and if it
      is thought necessary, destroy it piecemeal from within.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Maqueda consulted with her councillors, who appeared to be much
      disturbed at this suggestion, and finally called us back and gave us her
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;These lords of the Council,&rdquo; she said, speaking with a ring of contempt
      in her voice, &ldquo;declare that your plan is mad, and that they will never
      sanction it because the Abati could not be persuaded to undertake so
      dangerous an enterprise as an attack upon the city of Harmac, which would
      end, they think, in all of them being killed. They point out, O Orme, that
      the prophecy is that the Fung will leave the plain of Harmac when their
      god is destroyed and not before, and that therefore it must be destroyed.
      They say, further, O Orme, that for a year you and your companions are the
      sworn servants of the Abati, and that it is your business to receive
      orders, not to give them, also that the condition upon which you earn your
      pay is that you destroy the idol of the Fung. This is the decision of the
      Council, spoken by the mouth of the prince Joshua, who command further
      that you shall at once set about the business to execute which you and
      your companions are present here in Mur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that <i>your</i> command also, O Child of Kings?&rdquo; answered Oliver,
      colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since I also think that the Abati can never be forced to attack the city
      of the Fung, it is, O Orme, though the words in which it is couched are
      not my words.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, O Child of Kings, I will do my best. Only blame us not if the
      end of this matter is other than these advisers of yours expect.
      Prophecies are two-edged swords to play with, and I do not believe that a
      race of fighting men like the Fung will fly and leave you triumphant just
      because a stone image is shattered, if that can be done in the time and
      with the means which we possess. Meanwhile, I ask that you should give me
      two hundred and fifty picked men of the Mountaineers, not of the
      townspeople, under the captaincy of Japhet, who must choose them, to
      assist us in our work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; she answered, and we made our bows and went. As we
      passed through the Council we heard Joshua say in a loud voice meant for
      us to hear:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks be to God, these hired Gentiles have been taught their place at
      last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver turned on him so fiercely that he recoiled, thinking that he was
      about to strike him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful, Prince Joshua,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that before this business is
      finished you are not taught yours, which I think may be lowly,&rdquo; and he
      looked meaningly at the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the labour began, and it was heavy indeed as well as dangerous.
      Fortunately, in addition to the picrate compounds that Quick called &ldquo;azure
      stinging bees,&rdquo; we had brought with us a few cases of dynamite, of which
      we now made use for blasting purposes. A hole was drilled in the face of
      the tunnel, and the charge inserted. Then all retreated back into the Tomb
      of Kings till the cartridge had exploded, and the smoke cleared off, which
      took a long while, when our people advanced with iron bars and baskets,
      and cleared away the débris, after which the process must be repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the heat of that narrow hole deep in the bowels of the rock, and the
      reek of the stagnant air which sometimes was so bad that the lights would
      scarcely burn. Indeed, after a hundred feet had been completed, we thought
      that it would be impossible to proceed, since two men died of asphyxiation
      and the others, although they were good fellows enough, refused to return
      into the tunnel. At length, however, Orme and Japhet persuaded some of the
      best of them to do so, and shortly after this the atmosphere improved very
      much, I suppose because we cut some cranny or shaft which communicated
      with the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were other dangers also, notably of the collapse of the whole roof
      where the rock was rotten, as we found it to be in places. Then it proved
      very hard to deal with the water, for once or twice we struck small
      springs impregnated with copper or some other mineral that blistered the
      feet and skin, since every drop of this acid water had to be carried out
      in wooden pails. That difficulty we overcame at last by sinking a narrow
      well down to the level of the ancient tunnel of which I have spoken as
      having been shaken in by the earthquake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus we, or rather Oliver and Quick with the Mountaineers, toiled on.
      Higgs did his best, but after a while proved quite unable to bear the
      heat, which became too much for so stout a man. The end of it was that he
      devoted himself to the superintendence of the removal of the rubbish into
      the Tomb of Kings, the care of the stores and so forth. At least that was
      supposed to be his business, but really he employed most of his time in
      drawing and cataloguing the objects of antiquity and the groups of bones
      that were buried there, and in exploring the remains of the underground
      city. In truth, this task of destruction was most repellent to the poor
      Professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think,&rdquo; he said to us, &ldquo;to think that I, who all my life have preached
      the iniquity of not conserving every relic of the past, should now be
      employed in attempting to obliterate the most wonderful object ever
      fashioned by the ancients! It is enough to make a Vandal weep, and I pray
      heaven that you may not succeed in your infamous design. What does it
      matter if the Abati are wiped out, as lots of better people have been
      before them? What does it matter if we accompany them to oblivion so long
      as that noble sphinx is preserved to be the wonder of future generations?
      Well, thank goodness, at any rate I have seen it, which is more, probably,
      than any of you will ever do. There, another brute is dumping his rubbish
      over the skull of No. 14!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus we laboured continually, each at his different task, for the work in
      the mine never stopped, Oliver being in charge during the day and Quick at
      night for a whole week, since on each Sunday they changed with their
      gangs, Quick taking the day shift and Oliver the night, or <i>vice versa</i>.
      Sometimes Maqueda came down the cave to inspect progress, always, I
      noticed, at those hours when Oliver happened to be off duty. Then on this
      pretext or on that they would wander away together to visit I know not
      what in the recesses of the underground city, or elsewhere. In vain did I
      warn them that their every step was dogged, and that their every word and
      action were noted by spies who crept after them continually, since twice I
      caught one of these gentry in the act. They were infatuated, and would not
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Oliver only left the underground city twice or thrice a week
      to breathe the fresh air for an hour or two. In truth, he had no leisure.
      For this same reason he fitted himself up a bed in what had been a
      priest&rsquo;s chamber, or a sanctuary in the old temple, and slept there,
      generally with no other guard but the great dog, Pharaoh, his constant
      companion even in the recesses of the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to see how this faithful beast accustomed itself to the
      darkness, and made its other senses, especially that of smell, serve the
      purpose of eyes as do the blind. By degrees, too, it learned all the
      details of the operations; thus, when the cartridge was in place for
      firing, it would rise and begin to walk out of the tunnel even before the
      men in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night the tragedy that I feared very nearly happened, and indeed must
      have happened had it not been for this same hound, Pharaoh. About six
      o&rsquo;clock in the evening Oliver came off duty after an eight-hour shift in
      the tunnel, leaving Higgs in command for a little while until it was time
      for Quick to take charge. I had been at work outside all day in connection
      with the new conscript army, a regiment of which was in revolt, because
      the men, most of whom were what we should call small-holders, declared
      that they wanted to go home to weed their crops. Indeed, it had proved
      necessary for the Child of Kings herself to be summoned to plead with them
      and condemn some of the ringleaders to punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at length this business was over we left together, and the poor lady,
      exasperated almost to madness, sharply refusing the escort of any of her
      people, requested me to accompany her to the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mouth of the tunnel she met Oliver, as probably she had arranged to
      do, and after he had reported progress to her, wandered away with him as
      usual, each of them carrying a lamp, into some recess of the buried city.
      I followed them at a distance, not from curiosity, or because I wished to
      see more of the wonders of that city whereof I was heartily sick, but
      because I suspected that they were being spied upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pair vanished round a corner that I knew ended in a <i>cul-de-sac</i>,
      so extinguishing my lamp, I sat down on a fallen column and waited till I
      should see their light reappear, when I proposed to effect my retreat.
      Whilst I sat thus, thinking on many things and, to tell the truth, very
      depressed in mind, I heard a sound as of some one moving and instantly
      struck a match. The light of it fell full upon the face of a man whom I
      recognized at once as a body-servant of the prince Joshua, though whether
      he was passing me toward the pair or returning from their direction I
      could not be sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that to you, Physician?&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the match burnt out, and before I could light another he had
      vanished, like a snake into a stone wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      My first impulse was to warn Maqueda and Oliver that they were being
      watched, but reflecting that the business was awkward, and that the spy
      would doubtless have given over his task for this day, I left it alone,
      and went down to the Tomb of the Kings to help Higgs. Just afterwards
      Quick came on duty, long before his time, the fact being that he had no
      confidence in the Professor as a director of mining operations. When he
      appeared Higgs and I retreated from that close and filthy tunnel, and, by
      way of recreation, put in an hour or so at the cataloguing and
      archæological research in which his soul delighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only we could get all this lot out of Mur,&rdquo; he said, with a sweep of
      his hand, &ldquo;we should be the most famous men in Europe for at least three
      days, and rich into the bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ptolemy,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;we shall be fortunate if we get ourselves alive
      out of Mur, let alone these bones and ancient treasures,&rdquo; and I told him
      what I had seen that evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fat and kindly face grew anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t blame him; should probably do the same
      myself if I got the chance, and so would you&mdash;if you were twenty
      years younger. No, I don&rsquo;t blame him, or her either, for the fact is that
      although their race, education, and circumstances are so different, they
      are one of Nature&rsquo;s pairs, and while they are alive nothing will keep them
      apart. You might as well expect a magnet and a bit of iron to remain
      separate on a sheet of notepaper. Moreover, they give themselves away, as
      people in that state always do. The pursuit of archæology has its dangers,
      but it is a jolly sight safer than that of woman, though it did land me in
      a den of lions. What&rsquo;s going to happen, old fellow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say, but I think it very probable that Oliver will be murdered, and
      that we shall follow the same road, or, if we are lucky, be only bundled
      out of Mur. Well, it&rsquo;s time for dinner; if I get a chance I will give them
      a hint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we made our way to the old temple in the great cave, where we kept our
      stores and Oliver had his headquarters. Here we found him waiting for us
      and our meal ready, for food was always brought to us by the palace
      servants. When we had eaten and these men had cleared away, we lit our
      pipes and fed the dog Pharaoh upon the scraps that had been reserved for
      him. Then I told Oliver about the spy whom I had caught tracking him and
      Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what of it?&rdquo; he said, colouring in his tell-tale fashion; &ldquo;she only
      took me to see what she believed to be an ancient inscription on a column
      in that northern aisle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she&rsquo;d have done better to take me, my boy,&rdquo; said Higgs. &ldquo;What was
      the character like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered guiltily. &ldquo;She could not find it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An awkward silence followed, which I broke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oliver,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to go on sleeping here alone.
      You have too many enemies in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rubbish,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s true Pharaoh seemed uneasy last
      night, and that once I woke up and thought I heard footsteps in the court
      outside. I set them down to ghosts, in which I have almost come to believe
      in this haunted place, and went to sleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ghosts be blowed!&rdquo; said Higgs vulgarly, &ldquo;if there were such things I have
      slept with too many mummies not to see them. That confounded Joshua is the
      wizard who raises your ghosts. Look here, old boy,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let me camp
      with you to-night, since Quick must be in the tunnel, and Adams has to
      sleep outside in case he is wanted on the army business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;you know you are too asthmatical to get a
      wink in this atmosphere. I won&rsquo;t hear of such a thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come and sleep with us in the guest-house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done; the Sergeant has got a very nasty job down there about one
      o&rsquo;clock, and I promised to be handy in case he calls me up,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to the portable field telephone that fortunately we had brought
      with us from England, which was fixed closed by, adding, &ldquo;if only that
      silly thing had another few hundred yards of wire, I&rsquo;d come; but, you see,
      it hasn&rsquo;t and I must be in touch with the work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the bell tinkled, and Orme made a jump for the receiver
      through which for the next five minutes he was engaged in giving rapid and
      to us quite unintelligible directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he said, when he had replaced the mouthpiece on its hook,
      &ldquo;if I hadn&rsquo;t been here they would probably have had the roof of the tunnel
      down and killed some people. No, no; I can&rsquo;t leave that receiver unless I
      go back to the mine, which I am too tired to do. However, don&rsquo;t you fret.
      With a pistol, a telephone, and Pharaoh I&rsquo;m safe enough. And now, good
      night; you fellows had better be getting home as I must be up early
      to-morrow and want to sleep while I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning about five o&rsquo;clock Higgs and I were awakened by
      some one knocking at our door. I rose and opened it, whereon in walked
      Quick, a grim and grimy figure, for, as his soaked clothes and soiled face
      told us, he had but just left his work in the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain wants to see you as soon as possible, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Sergeant?&rdquo; asked Higgs, as we got into our garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see for yourself presently, Professor,&rdquo; was the laconic reply, nor
      could we get anything more out of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later we were advancing at a run through the dense darkness
      of the underground city, each of us carrying a lamp. I reached the ruins
      of the old temple first, for Quick seemed very tired and lagged behind,
      and in that atmosphere Higgs was scant of breath and could not travel
      fast. At the doorway of the place where he slept stood the tall form of
      Oliver holding a lamp aloft. Evidently he was waiting for us. By his side
      sat the big yellow dog, Pharaoh, that, when he smelt us, gambolled
      forward, wagging his tail in greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here,&rdquo; said Orme, in a low and solemn voice, &ldquo;I have something to
      show you,&rdquo; and he led the way into the priest&rsquo;s chamber, or sanctuary,
      whatever it may have been, where he slept upon a rough, native-made
      bedstead. At the doorway he halted, lowered the lamp he held, and pointed
      to something dark on the floor to the right of his bedstead, saying,
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There lay a dead man, and by his side a great knife that evidently had
      fallen from his hand. At the first glance we recognised the face which, by
      the way, was singularly peaceful, as though it were that of one plunged in
      deep sleep. This seemed odd, since the throat below was literally torn
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shadrach!&rdquo; we said, with one voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shadrach it was; Shadrach, our former guide, who had betrayed us; Shadrach
      who, to save his own life, had shown us how to rescue Higgs, and for that
      service been pardoned, as I think I mentioned. Shadrach and no other!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pussy seems to have been on the prowl and to have met a dog,&rdquo; remarked
      Quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand what has happened?&rdquo; asked Oliver, in a dry, hard voice.
      &ldquo;Perhaps I had better explain before anything is moved. Shadrach must have
      crept in here last night&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know at what time, for I slept
      through it all&mdash;for purposes of his own. But he forgot his old enemy
      Pharaoh, and Pharaoh killed him. See his throat? When Pharaoh bites he
      doesn&rsquo;t growl, and, of course, Shadrach could say nothing, or, as he had
      dropped his knife, for the matter of that, do anything either. When I was
      woke up about an hour ago by the telephone bell the dog was fast asleep,
      for he is accustomed to that bell, with his head resting upon the body of
      Shadrach. Now why did Shadrach come into my room at night with a drawn
      knife in his hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem a difficult question to answer,&rdquo; replied Higgs, in the high
      voice which was common to him when excited. &ldquo;He came here to murder you,
      and Pharaoh was too quick for him, that&rsquo;s all. That dog was the cheapest
      purchase you ever made, friend Oliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Orme, &ldquo;he came here to murder me&mdash;you were right
      about the risk, after all&mdash;but what I wonder is, who sent him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so you may go on wondering for the rest of your life, Captain,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Quick. &ldquo;Still, I think we might guess if we tried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then news of what had happened was sent to the palace, and within little
      over an hour Maqueda arrived, accompanied by Joshua and several other
      members of her Council. When she saw and understood everything she was
      horrified, and sternly asked Joshua what he knew of this business. Of
      course, he proved to be completely innocent, and had not the slightest
      idea of who had set the murderer on to work this deed of darkness. Nor had
      anybody else, the general suggestion being that Shadrach had attempted it
      out of revenge, and met with the due reward of his crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only that day poor Pharaoh was poisoned. Well, he had done his work, and
      his memory is blessed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      SERGEANT QUICK HAS A PRESENTIMENT
    </h3>
    <p>
      From this time forward all of us, and especially Oliver, were guarded
      night and day by picked men who it was believed could not be corrupted. As
      a consequence, the Tsar of Russia scarcely leads a life more irksome than
      ours became at Mur. Of privacy there was none left to us, since sentries
      and detectives lurked at every corner, while tasters were obliged to eat
      of each dish and drink from each cup before it touched our lips, lest our
      fate should be that of Pharaoh, whose loss we mourned as much as though
      the poor dog had been some beloved human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of all was it irksome, I think, to Oliver and Maqueda, whose
      opportunities of meeting were much curtailed by the exigencies of this
      rigid espionage. Who can murmur sweet nothings to his adored when two
      soldiers armed to the teeth have been instructed never to let him out of
      their sight? Particularly is this so if the adored happens to be the ruler
      of those soldiers to whom the person guarded has no right to be making
      himself agreeable. For when off duty even the most faithful guardians are
      apt to talk. Of course, the result was that the pair took risks which did
      not escape observation. Indeed, their intimate relations became a matter
      of gossip throughout the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, annoying as they might be, these precautions succeeded, for none of
      us were poisoned or got our throats cut, although we were constantly the
      victims of mysterious accidents. Thus, a heavy rock rolled down upon us
      when we sat together one evening upon the hill-side, and a flight of
      arrows passed between us while we were riding along the edge of a thicket,
      by one of which Higgs&rsquo;s horse was killed. Only when the mountain and the
      thicket were searched no one could be found. Moreover, a great plot
      against us was discovered in which some of the lords and priests were
      implicated, but such was the state of feeling in the country that, beyond
      warning them privately that their machinations were known, Maqueda did not
      dare to take proceedings against these men.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later on things mended so far as we were concerned, for the
      following reason: One day two shepherds arrived at the palace with some of
      their companions, saying that they had news to communicate. On being
      questioned, these peasants averred that while they were herding their
      goats upon the western cliffs many miles away, suddenly on the top of the
      hills appeared a body of fifteen Fung, who bound and blindfolded them,
      telling them in mocking language to take a message to the Council and to
      the white men.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the message: That they had better make haste to destroy the god
      Harmac, since otherwise his head would move to Mur according to the
      prophecy, and that when it did so, the Fung would follow as they knew how
      to do. Then they set the two men on a rock where they could be seen, and
      on the following morning were in fact found by some of their fellows,
      those who accompanied them to the Court and corroborated this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the matter was duly investigated, but as I know, for I went with
      the search party, when we got to the place no trace of the Fung could be
      found, except one of their spears, of which the handle had been driven
      into the earth and the blade pointed toward Mur, evidently in threat or
      defiance. No other token of them remained, for, as it happened, a heavy
      rain had fallen and obliterated their footprints, which in any case must
      have been faint on this rocky ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the most diligent search by skilled men, their mode of
      approach and retreat remained a mystery, as, indeed, it does to this day.
      The only places where it was supposed to be possible to scale the
      precipice of Mur were watched continually, so that they could have climbed
      up by none of these. The inference was, therefore, that the Fung had
      discovered some unknown path, and, if fifteen men could climb that path,
      why not fifteen thousand!
    </p>
    <p>
      Only, where was this path? In vain were great rewards in land and honours
      offered to him who should discover it, for although such discoveries were
      continually reported, on investigation these were found to be inventions
      or mares&rsquo; nests. Nothing but a bird could have travelled by such roads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then at last we saw the Abati thoroughly frightened, for, with additions,
      the story soon passed from mouth to mouth till the whole people talked of
      nothing else. It was as though we English learned that a huge foreign army
      had suddenly landed on our shores and, having cut the wires and seized the
      railways, was marching upon London. The effect of such tidings upon a
      nation that always believed invasion to be impossible may easily be
      imagined, only I hope that we should take them better than did the Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their swagger, their self-confidence, their talk about the &ldquo;rocky walls of
      Mur,&rdquo; evaporated in an hour. Now it was only of the disciplined and
      terrible regiments of the Fung, among whom every man was trained to war,
      and of what would happen to them, the civilized and domesticated Abati, a
      peace-loving people who rightly enough, as they declared, had refused all
      martial burdens, should these regiments suddenly appear in their midst.
      They cried out that they were betrayed&mdash;they clamoured for the blood
      of certain of the Councillors. That carpet knight, Joshua, lost popularity
      for a while, while Maqueda, who was known always to have been in favour of
      conscription and perfect readiness to repel attack, gained what he had
      lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving their farms, they crowded together into the towns and villages,
      where they made what in South Africa are called laagers. Religion, which
      practically had been dead among them, for they retained but few traces of
      the Jewish faith if, indeed, they had ever really practised it, became the
      craze of the hour. Priests were at a premium; sheep and cattle were
      sacrificed; it was even said that, after the fashion of their foes the
      Fung, some human beings shared the same fate. At any rate the Almighty was
      importuned hourly to destroy the hated Fung and to protect His people&mdash;the
      Abati&mdash;from the results of their own base selfishness and cowardly
      neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the world has seen such exhibitions before to-day, and will
      doubtless see more of them in the instance of greater peoples who allow
      luxury and pleasure-seeking to sap their strength and manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The upshot of it all was that the Abati became obsessed with the saying of
      the Fung scouts to the shepherds, which, after all, was but a repetition
      of that of their envoys delivered to the Council a little while before:
      that they should hasten to destroy the idol Harmac, lest he should move
      himself to Mur. How an idol of such proportions, or even its head, could
      move at all they did not stop to inquire. It was obvious to them, however,
      that if he was destroyed there would be nothing to move and, further, that
      we Gentiles were the only persons who could possibly effect such
      destruction. So we also became popular for a little while. Everybody was
      pleasant and flattered us&mdash;everybody, even Joshua, bowed when we
      approached, and took a most lively interest in the progress of our work,
      which many deputations and prominent individuals urged us to expedite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better still, the untoward accidents such as those I have mentioned,
      ceased. Our dogs, for we had obtained some others, were no longer
      poisoned; rocks that appeared fixed did not fall; no arrows whistled among
      us when we went out riding. We even found it safe occasionally to dispense
      with our guards, since it was every one&rsquo;s interest to keep us alive&mdash;for
      the present. Still, I for one was not deceived for a single moment, and in
      season and out of season warned the others that the wind would soon blow
      again from a less favourable quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      We worked, we worked, we worked! Heaven alone knows how we did work. Think
      of the task, which, after all, was only one of several. A tunnel must be
      bored, for I forget how far, through virgin rock, with the help of
      inadequate tools and unskilled labour, and this tunnel must be finished by
      a certain date. A hundred unexpected difficulties arose, and one by one
      were conquered. Great dangers must be run, and were avoided, while the
      responsibility of this tremendous engineering feat lay upon the shoulders
      of a single individual, Oliver Orme, who, although he had been educated as
      an engineer, had no great practical experience of such enterprises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly the occasion makes the man, for Orme rose to it in a way that I can
      only call heroic. When he was not actually in the tunnel he was labouring
      at his calculations, of which many must be made, or taking levels with
      such instruments as he had. For if there proved to be the slightest error
      all this toil would be in vain, and result only in the blowing of a
      useless hole through a mass of rock. Then there was a great question as to
      the effect which would be produced by the amount of explosive at his
      disposal, since terrible as might be the force of the stuff, unless it
      were scientifically placed and distributed it would assuredly fail to
      accomplish the desired end.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after superhuman efforts, the mine was finished. Our stock of
      concentrated explosive, about four full camel loads of it, was set in as
      many separate chambers, each of them just large enough to receive the
      charge, hollowed in the primæval rock from which the idol had been hewn.
    </p>
    <p>
      These chambers were about twenty feet from each other, although if there
      had been time to prolong the tunnel, the distance should have been at
      least forty in order to give the stuff a wider range of action. According
      to Oliver&rsquo;s mathematical reckoning, they were cut in the exact centre of
      the base of the idol, and about thirty feet below the actual body of the
      crouching sphinx. As a matter of fact this reckoning was wrong in several
      particulars, the charges having been set farther toward the east or head
      of the sphinx and higher up in the base than he supposed. When it is
      remembered that he had found no opportunity of measuring the monument
      which practically we had only seen once from behind under conditions not
      favourable to accuracy in such respects, or of knowing its actual length
      and depth, these trifling errors were not remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was remarkable is that his general plan of operations, founded upon a
      mere hypothetical estimate, should have proved as accurate as it did.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length all was prepared, and the deadly cast-iron flasks had been
      packed in sand, together with dynamite cartridges, the necessary
      detonators, electric wires, and so forth, an anxious and indeed awful task
      executed entirely in that stifling atmosphere by the hands of Orme and
      Quick. Then began another labour, that of the filling in of the tunnels.
      This, it seems, was necessary, or so I understood, lest the expanding
      gases, following the line of least resistance, should blow back, as it
      were, through the vent-hole. What made that task the more difficult was
      the need of cutting a little channel in the rock to contain the wires, and
      thereby lessen the risk of the fracture of these wires in the course of
      the building-up process. Of course, if by any accident this should happen,
      the circuit would be severed, and no explosion would follow when the
      electric battery was set to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrangement was that the mine should be fired on the night of that
      full moon on which we had been told, and spies confirmed the information,
      the feast of the marriage of Barung&rsquo;s daughter to my son would be
      celebrated in the city of Harmac. This date was fixed because the Sultan
      had announced that so soon as that festivity, which coincided with the
      conclusion of the harvest, was ended, he meant to deliver his attack on
      Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, we were anxious that it should be adhered to for another reason,
      since we knew that on this day but a small number of priests and guards
      would be left in charge of the idol, and my son could not be among them.
      Now, whatever may have been the views of the Abati, we as Christians who
      bore them no malice did not at all desire to destroy an enormous number of
      innocent Fung, as might have happened if we had fired our mine when the
      people were gathered to sacrifice to their god.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fatal day arrived at last. All was completed, save for the blocking of
      the passage, which still went on, or, rather, was being reinforced by the
      piling up of loose rocks against its mouth, at which a hundred or so men
      laboured incessantly. The firing wires had been led into that little
      chamber in the old temple where the dog Pharaoh tore out the throat of
      Shadrach, and no inch of them was left unguarded for fear of accident or
      treachery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The electric batteries&mdash;two of them, in case one should fail&mdash;had
      been tested but not connected with the wires. There they stood upon the
      floor, looking innocent enough, and we four sat round them like wizards
      round their magic pot, who await the working of some spell. We were not
      cheerful; who could be under so intense a strain? Orme, indeed, who had
      grown pale and thin with continuous labour of mind and body, seemed quite
      worn out. He could not eat nor smoke, and with difficulty I persuaded him
      to drink some of the native wine. He would not even go to look at the
      completion of the work or to test the wires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see to it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have done all I can. Now things must take
      their chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After our midday meal he lay down and slept quite soundly for several
      hours. About four o&rsquo;clock those who were labouring at the piling up of
      débris over the mouth of the tunnel completed their task, and, in charge
      of Quick, were marched out of the underground city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Higgs and I took lamps and went along the length of the wires, which
      lay in a little trench covered over with dust, removing the dust and
      inspecting them at intervals. Discovering nothing amiss, we returned to
      the old temple, and at its doorway met the mountaineer, Japhet, who
      throughout all these proceedings had been our prop and stay. Indeed,
      without his help and that of his authority over the Abati the mine could
      never have been completed, at any rate within the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light of the lamp showed that his face was very anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Physician,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I have words for the ear of the Captain Orme.
      Be pleased to lead me to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We explained that he slept and could not be disturbed, but Japhet only
      answered as before, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come you with me, my words are for your ears as well as his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we went into the little room and awoke Oliver, who sprang up in a great
      fright, thinking that something untoward had happened at the mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked of Japhet. &ldquo;Have the Fung cut the wires?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, O Orme, a worse thing; I have discovered that the Prince Joshua has
      laid a plot to steal away &lsquo;Her-whose-name-is-high.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean? Set out all the story, Japhet,&rdquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is short, lord. I have some friends, one of whom&mdash;he is of my own
      blood, but ask me not his name&mdash;is in the service of the Prince. We
      drank a cup of wine together, which I needed, and I suppose it loosed his
      tongue. At any rate, he told me, and I believed him. This is the story.
      For his own sake and that of the people the Prince desires that you should
      destroy the idol of Fung, and therefore he has kept his hands off you of
      late. Yet should you succeed, he does not know what may happen. He fears
      lest the Abati in their gratitude should set you up as great men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he is an ass!&rdquo; interrupted Quick; &ldquo;for the Abati have no gratitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fears,&rdquo; went on Japhet, &ldquo;other things also. For instance, that the
      Child of Kings may express that gratitude by a mark of her signal favour
      toward one of you,&rdquo; and he stared at Orme, who turned his head aside.
      &ldquo;Now, the Prince is affianced to this great lady, whom he desires to wed
      for two reasons: First, because this marriage will make him the chief man
      amongst the Abati, and, secondly, because of late he has come to think
      that he loves her whom he is afraid that he may lose. So he has set a
      snare.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What snare?&rdquo; asked one of us, for Japhet paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Japhet, &ldquo;and I do not think that my friend knew
      either, or, if he did, he would not tell me. But I understand the plot is
      that the Child of Kings is to be carried off to the Prince Joshua&rsquo;s castle
      at the other end of the lake, six hours&rsquo; ride away, and there be forced to
      marry him at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Orme, &ldquo;and when is all this to happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, lord. I know nothing except what my friend told me, which I
      thought it right to communicate to you instantly. I asked him the time,
      however, and he said that he believed the date was fixed for one night
      after next Sabbath.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Next Sabbath is five days hence, so that this matter does not seem to be
      very pressing,&rdquo; remarked Oliver with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;Are you sure that
      you can trust your friend, Japhet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, lord, I am not sure, especially as I have always known him to be a
      liar. Still, I thought that I ought to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very kind of you, Japhet, but I wish that you had let me have my sleep
      out first. Now go down the line and see that all is right, then return and
      report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Japhet saluted in his native fashion and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think of this story?&rdquo; asked Oliver, as soon as he was out of
      hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All bosh,&rdquo; answered Higgs; &ldquo;the place is full of talk and rumours, and
      this is one of them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused and looked at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I agree with Higgs. If Japhet&rsquo;s friend had really anything
      to tell he would have told it in more detail. I daresay there are a good
      many things Joshua would like to do, but I expect he will stop there, at
      any rate, for the present. If you take my advice you will say nothing of
      the matter, especially to Maqueda.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we are all agreed. But what are you thinking of, Sergeant?&rdquo; asked
      Oliver, addressing Quick, who stood in a corner of the room, lost
      apparently in contemplation of the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I, Captain,&rdquo; he replied, coming to attention. &ldquo;Well, begging their
      pardon, I was thinking that I don&rsquo;t hold with these gentlemen, except in
      so far that I should say nothing of this job to our Lady, who has plenty
      to bother her just now, and won&rsquo;t need to be frightened as well. Still,
      there may be something in it, for though that Japhet is stupid, he&rsquo;s
      honest, and honest men sometimes get hold of the right end of the stick.
      At least, he believes there is something, and that&rsquo;s what weighs with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if that&rsquo;s your opinion, what&rsquo;s best to be done Sergeant? I agree
      that the Child of Kings should not be told, and I shan&rsquo;t leave this place
      till after ten o&rsquo;clock to-night at the earliest, if we stick to our plans,
      as we had better do, for all that stuff in the tunnel wants a little time
      to settle, and for other reasons. What are you drawing there?&rdquo; and he
      pointed to the floor, in the dust of which Quick was tracing something
      with his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A plan of our Lady&rsquo;s private rooms, Captain. She told you she was going
      to rest at sundown, didn&rsquo;t she, or earlier, for she was up most of last
      night, and wanted to get a few hours&rsquo; sleep before&mdash;something
      happens. Well, her bed-chamber is there, isn&rsquo;t it? and another before it,
      in which her maids sleep, and nothing behind except a high wall and a
      ditch which cannot be climbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s quite true,&rdquo; interrupted Higgs. &ldquo;I got leave to make a plan of the
      palace, only there is a passage six feet wide and twenty long leading from
      the guard chamber to the ladies&rsquo; anteroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so, Professor, and that passage has a turn in it, if I remember
      right, so that two well-armed men could hold it against quite a lot.
      Supposing now that you and I, Professor, should go and take a nap in that
      guard-room, which will be empty, for the watch is set at the palace gate.
      We shan&rsquo;t be wanted here, since if the Captain can&rsquo;t touch off that mine,
      no one can, with the Doctor to help him just in case anything goes wrong,
      and Japhet guarding the line. I daresay there&rsquo;s nothing in this yarn, but
      who knows? There might be, and then we should blame ourselves. What do you
      say, Professor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I? Oh, I&rsquo;ll do anything you wish, though I should rather have liked to
      climb the cliff and watch what happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;d see nothing, Higgs,&rdquo; interrupted Oliver, &ldquo;except perhaps the
      reflection of a flash in the sky; so, if you don&rsquo;t mind, I wish you would
      go with the Sergeant. Somehow, although I am quite certain that we ought
      not to alarm Maqueda, I am not easy about her, and if you two fellows were
      there, I should know she was all right, and it would be a weight off my
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said Higgs; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll be off presently. Look here, give us
      that portable telephone, which is of no use anywhere else now. The wire
      will reach to the palace, and if the machine works all right we can talk
      to you and tell each other how things are going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ten minutes later they had made their preparations. Quick stepped up to
      Oliver and stood at attention, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ready to march. Any more orders, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not, Sergeant,&rdquo; he answered, lifting his eyes from the little
      batteries that he was watching as though they were live things. &ldquo;You know
      the arrangements. At ten o&rsquo;clock&mdash;that is about two hours hence&mdash;I
      touch this switch. Whatever happens it must not be done before, for fear
      lest the Doctor&rsquo;s son should not have left the idol, to say nothing of all
      the other poor beggars. The spies say that the marriage feast will not be
      celebrated until at least three hours after moonrise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what I heard when I was a prisoner,&rdquo; interrupted Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; answered Orme; &ldquo;but it is always well to allow a margin in
      case the procession should be delayed, or something. So until ten o&rsquo;clock
      I&rsquo;ve got to stop where I am, and you may be sure, Doctor, that under no
      circumstances shall I fire the mine before that hour, as indeed you will
      be here to see. After that I can&rsquo;t say what will happen, but if we don&rsquo;t
      appear, you two had better come to look for us&mdash;in case of accidents,
      you know. Do your best at your end according to circumstances; the Doctor
      and I will do our best at ours. I think that is all, Sergeant. Report
      yourselves by the telephone if the wire is long enough and it will work,
      which I daresay it won&rsquo;t, and, anyway, look out for us about half-past
      ten. Good-bye!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Captain,&rdquo; answered Quick, then stretched out his hand, shook
      that of Orme, and without another word took his lamp and left the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      An impulse prompted me to follow him, leaving Orme and Higgs discussing
      something before they parted. When he had walked about fifty yards in the
      awful silence of that vast underground town, of which the ruined tenements
      yawned on either side of us, the Sergeant stopped and said suddenly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe in presentiments, do you, Doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad of it, Doctor. Still, I have got a bad one now, and it is that I
      shan&rsquo;t see the Captain or you any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s a poor look-out for us, Quick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Doctor, for me. I think you are both all right, and the Professor,
      too. It&rsquo;s my name they are calling up aloft, or so it seems to me. Well, I
      don&rsquo;t care much, for, though no saint, I have tried to do my duty, and if
      it is done, it&rsquo;s done. If it&rsquo;s written, it&rsquo;s got to come to pass, hasn&rsquo;t
      it? For everything is written down for us long before we begin, or so I&rsquo;ve
      always thought. Still, I&rsquo;ll grieve to part from the Captain, seeing that I
      nursed him as a child, and I&rsquo;d have liked to know him well out of this
      hole, and safely married to that sweet lady first, though I don&rsquo;t doubt
      that it will be so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Sergeant,&rdquo; I said sharply; &ldquo;you are not yourself; all this work
      and anxiety has got on your nerves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As it well might, Doctor, not but I daresay that&rsquo;s true. Anyhow, if the
      other is the true thing, and you should all see old England again with
      some of the stuff in that dead-house, I&rsquo;ve got three nieces living down at
      home whom you might remember. Don&rsquo;t say nothing of what I told you to the
      Captain till this night&rsquo;s game is played, seeing that it might upset him,
      and he&rsquo;ll need to keep cool up to ten o&rsquo;clock, and afterwards too,
      perhaps. Only if we shouldn&rsquo;t meet again, say that Samuel Quick sent him
      his duty and God&rsquo;s blessing. And the same on yourself, Doctor, and your
      son, too. And now here comes the Professor, so good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A minute later they had left me, and I stood watching them until the two
      stars of light from their lanterns vanished into the blackness.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      HARMAC COMES TO MUR
    </h3>
    <p>
      Slowly and in very bad spirits I retraced my steps to the old temple,
      following the line of the telephone wire which Higgs and Quick had
      unreeled as they went. In the Sergeant&rsquo;s prognostications of evil I had no
      particular belief, as they seemed to me to be born of the circumstances
      which surrounded us, and in different ways affected all our minds, even
      that of the buoyant Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To take my own case, for instance. Here I was about to assist in an act
      which for aught I knew might involve the destruction of my only son. It
      was true we believed that this was the night of his marriage at the town
      of Harmac, some miles away, and that the tale of our spies supported this
      information. But how could we be sure that the date, or the place of the
      ceremony, had not been changed at the last moment? Supposing, for
      instance, that it was held, not in the town, as arranged, but in the
      courts of the idol, and that the fearful activities of the fiery agent
      which we were about to wake to life should sweep the celebrants into
      nothingness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought made me turn cold, and yet the deed must be done; Roderick
      must take his chance. And if all were well, and he escaped that danger,
      were there not worse behind? Think of him, a Christian man, the husband of
      a savage woman who worshipped a stone image with a lion&rsquo;s head, bound to
      her and her tribe, a state prisoner, trebly guarded, whom, so far as I
      could see, there would be no hope of rescuing. It was awful. Then there
      were other complications. If the plan succeeded and the idol was
      destroyed, my own belief was that the Fung must thereby be exasperated.
      Evidently they knew some road into this stronghold. It would be used. They
      would pour their thousands up it, a general massacre would follow, of
      which, justly, we should be the first victims.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached the chamber where Oliver sat brooding alone, for Japhet was
      patrolling the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not happy about Maqueda, Doctor,&rdquo; he said to me. &ldquo;I am afraid there
      is something in that story. She wanted to be with us; indeed, she begged
      to be allowed to come almost with tears. But I wouldn&rsquo;t have it, since
      accidents may always happen; the vibration might shake in the roof or
      something; in fact, I don&rsquo;t think you should be here. Why don&rsquo;t you go
      away and leave me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I answered that nothing would induce me to do so, for such a job should
      not be left to one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I might faint or lose my head or anything. I
      wish now that we had arranged to send the spark from the palace, which
      perhaps we might have done by joining the telephone wire on to the others.
      But, to tell you the truth, I&rsquo;m afraid of the batteries. The cells are new
      but very weak, for time and the climate have affected them, and I thought
      it possible the extra difference might make the difference and that they
      would fail to work. That&rsquo;s why I fixed this as the firing point. Hullo,
      there&rsquo;s the bell. What have they got to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I snatched the receiver, and presently heard the cheerful voice of Higgs
      announcing that they had arrived safely in the little anteroom to
      Maqueda&rsquo;s private apartments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The palace seems very empty,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;we only met one sentry, for I
      think that everybody else, except Maqueda and a few of her ladies, have
      cleared out, being afraid lest rocks should fall on them when the
      explosion occurs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did the man say so?&rdquo; I asked of Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, something of that sort; also he wanted to forbid us to come here,
      saying that it was against the Prince Joshua&rsquo;s orders that we Gentiles
      should approach the private apartments of the Child of Kings. Well, we
      soon settled that, and he bolted. Where to? Oh! I don&rsquo;t know; to report,
      he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&rsquo;s Quick?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much the same as usual. In fact, he is saying his prayers in the corner,
      looking like a melancholy brigand with rifles, revolvers, and knives stuck
      all over him. I wish he wouldn&rsquo;t say his prayers,&rdquo; added Higgs, and his
      voice reached me in an indignant squeak; &ldquo;it makes me feel uncomfortable,
      as though I ought to join him. But not having been brought up a Dissenter
      or a Moslem, I can&rsquo;t pray in public as he does. Hullo! Wait a minute, will
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a longish pause, and after it Higgs&rsquo;s voice again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; it said. &ldquo;Only one of Maqueda&rsquo;s ladies who had heard us
      and come to see who we were. When she learns I expect she will join us
      here, as the girl says she&rsquo;s nervous and can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Higgs proved right in his anticipations, for in about ten minutes we were
      rung up again, this time by Maqueda herself, whereon I handed the receiver
      to Oliver and retired to the other end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor, to tell the truth, was I sorry for the interruption, since it cheered
      up Oliver and helped to pass the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next thing worth telling that happened was that, an hour or more
      later, Japhet arrived, looking very frightened. We asked him our usual
      question: if anything was wrong with the wires. With a groan he answered
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the wires seemed all right, but he had met a ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What ghost, you donkey?&rdquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The ghost of one of the dead kings, O Physician, yonder in the burial
      cave. It was he with the bent bones who sits in the farthest chair. Only
      he had put some flesh on his bones, and I tell you he looked fearful, a
      very fierce man, or rather ghost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, and did he say anything to you, Japhet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! yes, plenty, O Physician, only I could not understand it all, because
      his language was somewhat different to mine, and he spat out his words as
      a green log spits out sparks. I think that he asked me, however, how my
      miserable people dared to destroy his god, Harmac. I answered that I was
      only a servant and did not know, adding that he should put his questions
      to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did he say to that, Japhet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he said that Harmac would come to Mur and settle his account with
      the Abati, and that the foreign men would be wise to fly fast and far.
      That&rsquo;s all I understood; ask me no more, who would not return into that
      cave to be made a prince.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got hold of what Barung&rsquo;s envoys told us,&rdquo; said Oliver,
      indifferently, &ldquo;and no wonder, this place is enough to make anybody see
      ghosts. I&rsquo;ll repeat it to Maqueda; it will amuse her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I were you,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;for it isn&rsquo;t exactly a cheerful
      yarn, and perhaps she&rsquo;s afraid of ghosts too. Also,&rdquo; and I pointed to the
      watch that lay on the table beside the batteries, &ldquo;it is five minutes to
      ten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oh! that last five minutes! It seemed as many centuries. Like stone
      statues we sat, each of us lost in his own thoughts, though for my part
      the power of clear thinking appeared to have left me. Visions of a sort
      flowed over my mind without sinking into it, as water flows over marble.
      All I could do was fix my eyes on the face of that watch, of which in the
      flickering lamp-light the second-hand seemed to my excited fancy to grow
      enormous and jump from one side of the room to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orme began to count aloud. &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five&mdash;<i>now</i>!&rdquo;
       and almost simultaneously he touched the knob first of one battery and
      next of the other. Before his finger pressed the left-hand knob I felt the
      solid rock beneath us surge&mdash;no other word conveys its movement. Then
      the great stone cross-piece, weighing several tons, that was set as a
      transom above the tall door of our room, dislodged itself, and fell quite
      gently into the doorway, which it completely blocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other rocks fell also at a distance, making a great noise, and somehow I
      found myself on the ground, my stool had slid away from me. Next followed
      a muffled, awful roar, and with it came a blast of wind blowing where wind
      never blew before since the beginning of the world, that with a terrible
      wailing howled itself to silence in the thousand recesses of the cave
      city. As it passed our lamps went out. Lastly, quite a minute later I
      should think, there was a thud, as though something of enormous weight had
      fallen on the surface of the earth far above us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all was as it had been; all was darkness and utter quietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s over,&rdquo; said Oliver, in a strained voice which sounded very
      small and far away through that thick darkness; &ldquo;all over for good or ill.
      I needn&rsquo;t have been anxious; the first battery was strong enough, for I
      felt the mine spring as I touched the second. I wonder,&rdquo; he went on, as
      though speaking to himself, &ldquo;what amount of damage nearly a ton and a half
      of that awful azo-imide compound has done to the old sphinx. According to
      my calculations it ought to have been enough to break the thing up, if we
      could have spread the charge more. But, as it is, I am by no means
      certain. It may only have driven a hole in its bulk, especially if there
      were hollows through which the gases could run. Well, with luck, we may
      know more about it later. Strike a match, Adams, and light those lamps.
      Why, what&rsquo;s that? Listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, from somewhere came a series of tiny noises, that, though
      they were so faint and small, suggested rifles fired at a great distance.
      Crack, crack, crack! went the infinitesimal noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      I groped about, and finding the receiver of the field telephone, set it to
      my ear. In an instant all grew plain to me. Guns were being fired near the
      other end of the wire, and the transmitter was sending us the sound of
      them. Very faintly but with distinctness I could hear Higgs&rsquo;s high voice
      saying, &ldquo;Look out, Sergeant, there&rsquo;s another rush coming!&rdquo; and Quick
      answering, &ldquo;Shoot low, Professor; for the Lord&rsquo;s sake shoot low. You are
      empty, sir. Load up, load up! Here&rsquo;s a clip of cartridges. Don&rsquo;t fire too
      fast. Ah! that devil got me, but I&rsquo;ve got him; he&rsquo;ll never throw another
      spear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are being attacked!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Quick is wounded. Now Maqueda is
      talking to you. She says, &lsquo;Oliver, come! Joshua&rsquo;s men assail me. Oliver,
      come!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed a great sound of shouting answered by more shots, and just
      as Orme snatched the receiver from my hand the wire went dead. In vain he
      called down it in an agonized voice. As well might he have addressed the
      planet Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The wire&rsquo;s cut,&rdquo; he exclaimed, dashing down the receiver and seizing the
      lantern which Japhet had just succeeded in re-lighting; &ldquo;come on, there&rsquo;s
      murder being done,&rdquo; and he sprang to the doorway, only to stagger back
      again from the great stone with which it was blocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he screamed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re shut in. How can we get out? How can we
      get out?&rdquo; and he began to run round and round the room, and even to spring
      at the walls like a frightened cat. Thrice he sprang, striving to climb to
      the coping, for the place had no roof, each time falling back, since it
      was too high for him to grasp. I caught him round the middle, and held him
      by main force, although he struck at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;do you want to kill yourself? You will be no good
      dead or maimed. Let me think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Japhet was acting on his own account, for he, too, had heard the
      tiny, ominous sounds given out by the telephone and guessed their purport.
      First he ran to the massive transom that blocked the doorway and pushed.
      It was useless; not even an elephant could have stirred it. Then he
      stepped back, examining it carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it can be climbed, Physician,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Help me now,&rdquo; and he
      motioned to me to take one end of the heavy table on which the batteries
      stood. We dragged it to the doorway, and, seeing his purpose, Oliver
      jumped on to it with him. Then at Japhet&rsquo;s direction, while I supported
      the table to prevent its oversetting, Orme rested his forehead against the
      stone, making what schoolboy&rsquo;s call &ldquo;a back,&rdquo; up which the mountaineer
      climbed actively until he stood upon his shoulders, and by stretching
      himself was able to grasp the end of the fallen transom. Next, while I
      held up the lamp to give him light, he gripped the roughnesses of the hewn
      stone with his toes, and in a few moments was upon the coping of the wall,
      twenty feet or more above the floor line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rest was comparatively easy, for taking off his linen robe, Japhet
      knotted it once or twice, and let it down to us. By the help of this
      improvised rope, with Orme supporting me beneath, I, too, was dragged up
      to the coping of the wall. Then both of us pulled up Oliver, who, without
      a word, swung himself over the wall, hanging to Japhet&rsquo;s arms, and loosing
      his hold, dropped to the ground on the farther side. Next came my turn. It
      was a long fall, and had not Oliver caught me I think that I should have
      hurt myself. As it was, the breath was shaken out of me. Lastly, Japhet
      swung himself down, landing lightly as a cat. The lamps he had already
      dropped to us, and in another minute they were all lighted, and we were
      speeding down the great cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; I cried; &ldquo;there may be fallen rocks about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened I was right, for at that moment Oliver struck his legs
      against one of them and fell, cutting himself a good deal. In a moment he
      was up again, but after this our progress grew slow, for hundreds of tons
      of stone had been shaken from the roof and blocked the path. Also, whole
      buildings of the ancient and underground city had been thrown down,
      although these were mostly blown inward by the rush of air. At length we
      came to the end of the cave, and halted dismayed, for here, where the
      blast of the explosion had been brought to a full stop, the place seemed
      to be crowded with rocks which it had rolled before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! I believe we are shut in,&rdquo; exclaimed Oliver in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Japhet, lantern in hand, was already leaping from block to block, and
      presently, from the top of the débris, called to us to come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is a road left, though a bad one, lords,&rdquo; he said, and
      pointed to a jagged, well-like hole blown out, as I believe, by the recoil
      of the blast. With difficulty and danger, for many of the piled up stones
      were loose, we climbed down this place, and at its bottom squeezed
      ourselves through a narrow aperture on to the floor of the cave, praying
      that the huge door which led to the passage beyond might not be jammed,
      since if it were, as we knew well, our small strength would not avail to
      move it. Happily, this fear at least proved groundless, since it opened
      outward, and the force of the compressed air had torn it from its massive
      stone hinges and thrown it shattered to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      We scrambled over it, and advanced down the passage, our revolvers in our
      hands. We reached the audience hall, which was empty and in darkness. We
      turned to the left, crossing various chambers, and in the last of them,
      through which one of the gates of the palace could be approached, met with
      the first signs of the tragedy, for there were bloodstains on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Orme pointed to them as he hurried on, and suddenly a man leapt out of the
      darkness as a buck leaps from a bush, and ran past us, holding his hands
      to his side, where evidently he had some grievous hurt. Now we entered the
      corridor leading to the private apartments of the Child of Kings, and
      found ourselves walking on the bodies of dead and dying men. One of the
      former I observed, as one does notice little things at such a moment, held
      in his hand the broken wire of the field telephone. I presume that he had
      snatched and severed it in his death pang at the moment when communication
      ceased between us and the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      We rushed into the little antechamber, in which lights were burning, and
      there saw a sight that I for one never shall forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the foreground lay more dead men, all of them wearing the livery of
      Prince Joshua. Beyond was Sergeant Quick, seated on a chair. He seemed to
      be literally hacked to pieces. An arrow that no one had attempted to
      remove was fast in his shoulder; his head, which Maqueda was sponging with
      wet cloths&mdash;well, I will not describe his wounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaning against the wall near by stood Higgs, also bleeding, and
      apparently quite exhausted. Behind, besides Maqueda herself, were two or
      three of her ladies, wringing their hands and weeping. In face of this
      terrible spectacle we came to a sudden halt. No word was spoken of by any
      one, for the power of speech had left us.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dying Quick opened his eyes, lifted his hand, upon which there was a
      ghastly sword-cut, to his forehead, as though to shade them from the light&mdash;ah!
      how well I recall that pathetic motion&mdash;and from beneath this screen
      stared at us a while. Then he rose from the chair, touched his throat to
      show that he could not speak, as I suppose, saluted Orme, turned and
      pointed to Maqueda, and with a triumphant smile sank down and&mdash;died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the noble end of Sergeant Quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      To describe what followed is not easy, for the scene was confused. Also
      shock and sorrow have blurred its recollection in my mind. I remember
      Maqueda and Orme falling into each other&rsquo;s arms before everybody. I
      remember her drawing herself up in that imperial way of hers, and saying,
      as she pointed to the body of Quick:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There lies one who has shown us how to die. This countryman of yours was
      a hero, O Oliver, and you should hold his memory in honour, since he saved
      me from worse than death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the story?&rdquo; asked Orme of Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A simple one enough,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;We got here all right, as we told you
      over the wire. Then Maqueda talked to you for a long while until you rang
      off, saying you wanted to speak to Japhet. After that, at ten o&rsquo;clock
      precisely, we heard the thud of the explosion. Next, as we were preparing
      to go out to see what had happened, Joshua arrived alone, announced that
      the idol Harmac had been destroyed, and demanded that the Child of Kings,
      &lsquo;for State reasons,&rsquo; should accompany him to his own castle. She declined
      and, as he insisted, I took it upon myself to kick him out of the place.
      He retired, and we saw no more of him, but a few minutes later there came
      a shower of arrows down the passage, and after them a rush of men, who
      called, &lsquo;Death to the Gentiles. Rescue the Rose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we began to shoot and knocked over a lot of them, but Quick got that
      arrow through his shoulder. Three times they came on like that, and three
      times we drove them back. At last our cartridges ran low, and we only had
      our revolvers left, which we emptied into them. They hung a moment, but
      moved forward again, and all seemed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Quick went mad. He snatched the sword of a dead Abati and ran at
      them roaring like a bull. They hacked and cut at him, but the end of it
      was that he drove them right out of the passage, while I followed, firing
      past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, those who were left of the blackguards bolted, and when they had
      gone the Sergeant tumbled down. The women and I carried him back here, but
      he never said another word, and at last you turned up. Now he&rsquo;s gone, God
      rest him, for if ever there was a hero in this world he was christened
      Samuel Quick!&rdquo; and, turning aside, the Professor pushed up the blue
      spectacles he always wore on to his forehead, and wiped his eyes with the
      back of his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      With grief more bitter than I can describe we lifted up the body of the
      gallant Quick and, bearing it into Maqueda&rsquo;s private apartment, placed it
      on her own bed, for she insisted that the man who had died to protect her
      should be laid nowhere else. It was strange to see the grim old soldier,
      whose face, now that I had washed his wounds, looked calm and even
      beautiful, laid out to sleep his last sleep upon the couch of the Child of
      Kings. That bed, I remember, was a rich and splendid thing, made of some
      black wood inlaid with scrolls of gold, and having hung about it curtains
      of white net embroidered with golden stars, such as Maqueda wore upon her
      official veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      There upon the scented pillows and silken coverlet we set our burden down,
      the work-worn hands clasped upon the breast in an attitude of prayer, and
      one by one bid our farewell to this faithful and upright man, whose face,
      as it chanced, we were never to see again, except in the glass of memory.
      Well, he had died as he had lived and would have wished to die&mdash;doing
      his duty and in war. And so we left him. Peace be to his honoured spirit!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the blood-stained ante-room, while I dressed and stitched up the
      Professor&rsquo;s wounds, a sword-cut on the head, an arrow-graze along the
      face, and a spear-prick in the thigh, none of them happily at all deep or
      dangerous, we held a brief council.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; said Maqueda, who was leaning on her lover&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;it is not
      safe that we should stop here. My uncle&rsquo;s plot has failed for the moment,
      but it was only a small and secret thing. I think that soon he will return
      again with a thousand at his back, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is in your mind?&rdquo; asked Oliver. &ldquo;To fly from Mur?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can we fly,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;when the pass is guarded by Joshua&rsquo;s men,
      and the Fung wait for us without? The Abati hate you, my friends, and now
      that you have done your work I think that they will kill you if they can,
      whom they bore with only till it was done. Alas! alas! that I should have
      brought you to this false and ungrateful country,&rdquo; and she began to weep,
      while we stared at each other, helpless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Japhet, who all this while had been crouched on the floor, rocking
      himself too and fro and mourning in his Eastern fashion for Quick, whom he
      had loved, rose, and, coming to the Child of Kings, prostrated himself
      before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Walda Nagasta,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hear the words of your servant. Only three
      miles away, near to the mouth of the pass, are encamped five hundred men
      of my own people, the Mountaineers, who hate Prince Joshua and his
      following. Fly to them, O Walda Nagasta, for they will cleave to you and
      listen to me whom you have made a chief among them. Afterwards you can act
      as may seem wisest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda looked at Oliver questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that is good advice,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;At any rate, we can&rsquo;t be worse
      off among the Mountaineers than we are in this undefended place. Tell your
      women to bring cloaks that we can throw over our heads, and let us go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes later, a forlorn group filled with fears, we had stolen over
      the dead and dying in the passage, and made our way to the side gate of
      the palace that we found open, and over the bridge that spanned the moat
      beyond, which was down. Doubtless Joshua&rsquo;s ruffians had used it in their
      approach and retreat. Disguised in the long cloaks with monk-like hoods
      that the Abati wore at night or when the weather was cold and wet, we
      hurried across the great square. Here, since we could not escape them, we
      mingled with the crowd that was gathered at its farther end, all of them&mdash;men,
      women and children&mdash;chattering like monkeys in the tree-tops, and
      pointing to the cliff at the back of the palace, beneath which, it will be
      remembered, lay the underground city.
    </p>
    <p>
      A band of soldiers rode by, thrusting their way through the people, and in
      order to avoid them we thought it wise to take refuge in the shadow of a
      walk of green-leaved trees which grew close at hand, for we feared lest
      they might recognize Oliver by his height. Here we turned and looked up at
      the cliff, to discover what it was at which every one was staring. At that
      moment the full moon, which had been obscured by a cloud, broke out, and
      we saw a spectacle that under the circumstances was nothing less than
      terrifying.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cliff behind the palace rose to a height of about a hundred and fifty
      feet, and, as it chanced, just there a portion of it jutted out in an
      oblong shape, which the Abati called the Lion Rock, although personally,
      heretofore, I had never been able to see in it any great resemblance to a
      lion. Now, however, it was different, for on the very extremity of this
      rock, staring down at Mur, sat the head and neck of the huge lion-faced
      idol of the Fung. Indeed, in that light, with the promontory stretching
      away behind it, it looked as though it were the idol itself, moved from
      the valley upon the farther side of the precipice to the top of the cliff
      above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo; groaned Japhet, &ldquo;the prophecy is fulfilled&mdash;the head of
      Harmac has come to sleep at Mur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that we have sent him there,&rdquo; whispered Higgs. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      frightened, man; can&rsquo;t you understand that the power of our medicine has
      blown the head off the sphinx high into the air, and landed it where it
      sits now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I put in, &ldquo;and what we felt in the cave was the shock of its fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what brought him,&rdquo; replied Japhet, who seemed quite unstrung
      by all that he had gone through. &ldquo;All I know is that the prophecy is
      fulfilled, and Harmac has come to Mur, and where Harmac goes the Fung
      follow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said the irreverent Higgs. &ldquo;I may be able to sketch
      and measure him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I saw that Maqueda was trembling, for she, too, thought this
      occurrence a very bad omen, and even Oliver remained silent, perhaps
      because he feared its effect upon the Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this wonderful since, from the talk around us, clearly that effect
      was great. Evidently the people were terrified, like Japhet. We could hear
      them foreboding ill, and cursing us Gentiles as wizards, who had not
      destroyed the idol of the Fung as we promised, but had only caused him to
      fly to Mur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here I may mention that as a matter of fact they were right. As we
      discovered afterwards, the whole force of the explosion, instead of
      shattering the vast bulk of the stone image, had rushed up through the
      hollow chambers in its interior until it struck against the solid head.
      Lifting this as though it were a toy, the expanding gas had hurled that
      mighty mass an unknown distance into the air, to light upon the crest of
      the cliffs of Mur, where probably it will remain forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, when we had stared a little while at this extraordinary
      phenomenon, &ldquo;thank God it did not travel farther, and fall upon the
      palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! had it done so,&rdquo; whispered Maqueda in a tearful voice, &ldquo;I think you
      might have thanked God indeed, for then at least I should be free from all
      my troubles. Come, friends, let us be going before we are discovered.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I FIND MY SON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Our road toward the pass ran through the camping ground of the newly
      created Abati army, and what we saw on our journey thither told us more
      vividly than any words or reports could do, how utter was the
      demoralization of that people. Where should have been sentries were no
      sentries; where should have been soldiers were groups of officers talking
      with women; where should have been officers were camp followers drinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this confusion and excitement we made our way unobserved, or, at
      any rate, unquestioned, till at length we came to the regiment of the
      Mountaineers, who, for the most part, were goatherds, poor people who
      lived upon the slopes of the precipices that enclosed the land of Mur.
      These folk, having little to do with their more prosperous brethren of the
      plain, were hardy and primitive of nature, and therefore retained some of
      the primeval virtues of mankind, such as courage and loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for the first of these reasons, and, indeed, for the second also,
      that they had been posted by Joshua at the mouth of the pass, which he
      knew well they alone could be trusted to defend in the event of serious
      attack. Moreover, it was desirable, from his point of view, to keep them
      out of the way while he developed his plans against the person of the
      Child of Kings, for whom these simple-minded men had a hereditary and
      almost a superstitious reverence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as we were within the lines of these Mountaineers we found the
      difference between them and the rest of the Abati. The other regiments we
      had passed unchallenged, but here we were instantly stopped by a picket.
      Japhet whispered something into the ear of its officer that caused him to
      stare hard at us. Then this officer saluted the veiled figure of the Child
      of Kings and led us to where the commander of the band and his
      subordinates were seated near a fire sitting together. At some sign or
      word that did not reach us the commander, an old fellow with a long grey
      beard, rose and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pardon, but be pleased to show your faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda threw back her hood and turned so that the light of the moon fell
      full upon her, whereon the old man dropped to his knee, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your commands, O Walda Nagasta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summon your regiment and I will give them,&rdquo; she answered, and seated
      herself on a bench by the fire, we three and Japhet standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commander issued orders to his captains, and presently the
      Mountaineers formed up on three sides of a square above us, to the number
      of a little over five hundred men. When all were gathered Maqueda mounted
      the bench upon which she had been sitting, threw back her hood so that
      every one could see her face in the light of the fire, and addressed them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Men of the mountain-side, this night just after the idol of the Fung had
      been destroyed, the Prince Joshua, my uncle, came to me demanding my
      surrender to him, whether to kill me or to imprison me in his castle
      beyond the end of the lake, for reasons of State as he said, or for other
      vile purposes, I do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words a murmur rose from the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Maqueda, holding up her hand, &ldquo;there is worse to come. I told
      my uncle, Prince Joshua, that he was a traitor and had best be gone. He
      went, threatening me and, when I do not know, withdrew the guards that
      should be stationed at my palace gates. Now, some rumour of my danger had
      reached the foreigners in my service, and two of them, he who is called
      Black Windows, whom we rescued from the Fung, and the soldier named Quick,
      came to watch over me, while the Lord Orme and the Doctor Adams stayed in
      the cave to send out that spark of fire which should destroy the idol. Nor
      did they come back without need, for presently arrived a band of Prince
      Joshua&rsquo;s men to take me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Black Windows and the soldier his companion fought a good fight,
      they two holding the narrow passage against many, and slaying a number of
      them with their terrible weapons. The end of it was, men of the mountains,
      that the warrior Quick, charging down the passage, drove away those
      servants of Joshua who remained alive. But in so doing he was wounded to
      the death. Yes, that brave man lies dead, having given his life to save
      the Child of Kings from the hands of her own people. Black Windows also
      was wounded&mdash;see the bandages about his head. Then came the Lord Orme
      and the Doctor Adams, and with them your brother Japhet, who had barely
      escaped with their lives from the cave city, and knowing that I was no
      longer safe in the palace, where even my sleeping-room has been drenched
      with blood, with them I have fled to you for succour. Will you not protect
      me, O men of the mountain-side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; they answered with a great shout. &ldquo;Command we obey. What shall
      we do, O Child of Kings?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Maqueda called the officers of the regiment apart and consulted with
      them, asking their opinions, one by one. Some of them were in favour of
      finding out where Joshua might be, and attacking him at once. &ldquo;Crush the
      snake&rsquo;s head and its tail will soon cease wriggling!&rdquo; these said, and I
      confess this was a view that in many ways commended itself to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Maqueda would have none of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What!&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;shall I begin a civil war among my people when for
      aught I know the enemy is at our gates?&rdquo; adding aside to us, &ldquo;also, how
      can these few hundred men, brave though they be, hope to stand against the
      thousands under the command of Joshua?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, then, would you do?&rdquo; asked Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Return to the palace with these Mountaineers, O Oliver, and by help of
      that garrison, hold it against all enemies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;To those who are quite lost one road is as good
      as another; they must trust to the stars to guide them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; echoed Higgs; &ldquo;and the sooner we go the better, for my leg
      hurts, and I want a sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Maqueda gave her commands to the officers, by whom they were conveyed
      to the regiment, which received them with a shout, and instantly began to
      strike its camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it was, coming hot-foot after so much sorrow, loss and doubt, that
      there followed the happiest event of all my life. Utterly tired out and
      very despondent, I was seated on an arrow-chest awaiting the order to
      march, idly watching Oliver and Maqueda talking with great earnestness at
      a little distance, and in the intervals trying to prevent poor Higgs at my
      side from falling asleep. While I was thus engaged, suddenly I heard a
      disturbance, and by the bright moonlight caught sight of a man being led
      into the camp in charge of a guard of Abati soldiers, whom from their
      dress I knew to belong to a company that just then was employed in
      watching the lower gates of the pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took no particular heed of the incident, thinking only that they might
      have captured some spy, till a murmur of astonishment, and the general
      stir, warned me that something unusual had occurred. So I rose from my box
      and strolled towards the man, who now was hidden from me by a group of
      Mountaineers. As I advanced this group opened, the men who composed it
      bowing to me with a kind of wondering respect that impressed me, I did not
      know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for the first time I saw the prisoner. He was a tall, athletic young
      man, dressed in festal robes with a heavy gold chain about his neck, and I
      wondered vaguely what such a person should be doing here in this time of
      national commotion. He turned his head so that the moonlight showed his
      dark eyes, his somewhat oval-shaped face ending in a peaked black beard,
      and his finely cut features. In an instant I knew him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>It was my son Roderick!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Next moment, for the first time for very many years, he was in my arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing that I remember saying to him was a typically Anglo-Saxon
      remark, for however much we live in the East or elsewhere, we never really
      shake off our native conventions, and habits of speech. It was, &ldquo;How are
      you, my boy, and how on earth did you come here?&rdquo; to which he answered,
      slowly, it is true, and speaking with a foreign accent:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, thank you, father. I ran upon my legs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Higgs hobbled up, and was greeting my son warmly, for, of
      course, they were old friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought you were to be married to-night, Roderick?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I am half married according to Fung custom,
      which counts not to my soul. Look, this is the dress of marriage,&rdquo; and he
      pointed to his fine embroidered robe and rich ornaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, where&rsquo;s your wife?&rdquo; asked Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not know and I do not care,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for I did not like that
      wife. Also it is all nothing as I am not quite married to her. Fung
      marriage between big people takes two days to finish, and if not finished
      does not matter. So she marry some one else if she like, and I too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What happened then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this, father. When we had eaten the marriage feast, but before we
      past before priest, suddenly we hear a thunder and see a pillar of fire
      shoot up into sky, and sitting on top of it head of Harmac, which vanish
      into heaven and stop there. Then everybody jump up and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Magic of white man! Magic of white man! White man kill the god who sit
      there from beginning of world, now day of Fung finished according to
      prophecy. Run away, people of Fung, run away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Barung the Sultan tear his clothes too, and say&mdash;&lsquo;Run away, Fung,&rsquo; 
      and my half-wife, she tear <i>her</i> clothes and say nothing, but run
      like antelope. So they all run toward east, where great river is, and
      leave me alone. Then I get up and run too&mdash;toward west, for I know
      from Black Windows,&rdquo; and he pointed to Higgs, &ldquo;when we shut up together in
      belly of god before he let down to lions, what all this game mean, and
      therefore not frightened. Well, I run, meeting no one in night, till I
      come to pass, run up it, and find guards, to whom I tell story, so they
      not kill me, but let me through, and at last I come here, quite safe,
      without Fung wife, thank God, and that end of tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you are wrong there, my boy,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;out of the frying-pan
      into the fire, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of frying-pan into fire,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Not understand; father must
      remember I only little fellow when Khalifa&rsquo;s people take me, and since
      then speak no English till I meet Black Windows. Only he give me
      Bible-book that he have in pocket when he go down to be eat by lions.&rdquo;
       (Here Higgs blushed, for no one ever suspected him, a severe critic of all
      religions, of carrying a Bible in his pocket, and muttered something about
      &ldquo;ancient customs of the Hebrews.&rdquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Roderick, &ldquo;read that book ever since, and, as you see, all
      my English come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The question is,&rdquo; said Higgs, evidently in haste to talk of something
      else, &ldquo;will the Fung come back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Black Windows, don&rsquo;t know, can&rsquo;t say. Think not. Their prophecy was
      that Harmac move to Mur, but when they see his head jump into sky and stop
      there, they run every man toward the sunrise, and I think go on running.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Harmac has come to Mur, Roderick,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;at least his head has
      fallen on to the cliff that overlooks the city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! my father,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;then that make great difference. When Fung
      find out that head of Harmac has come here, no doubt they come after him,
      for head his most holy bit, especially as they want hang all the Abati
      whom they not like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s hope that they don&rsquo;t find out anything about it,&rdquo; I replied,
      to change the subject. Then taking Roderick by the hand I led him to where
      Maqueda stood a yard or two apart, listening to our talk, but, of course,
      understanding very little of it, and introduced him to her, explaining in
      a few words the wonderful thing that had happened. She welcomed him very
      kindly, and congratulated me upon my son&rsquo;s escape. Meanwhile, Roderick had
      been staring at her with evident admiration. Now he turned to us and said
      in his quaint broken English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walda Nagasta most lovely woman! No wonder King Solomon love her mother.
      If Barung&rsquo;s daughter, my wife, had been like her, think I run through
      great river into rising sun with Fung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver instantly translated this remark, which made us all laugh,
      including Maqueda herself, and very grateful we were to find the
      opportunity for a little innocent merriment upon that tragic night.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the regiment was ready to start, and had formed up into
      companies. Before the march actually began, however, the officer of the
      Abati patrol, in whose charge Roderick had been brought to us, demanded
      his surrender that he might deliver his prisoner to the
      Commander-in-Chief, Prince Joshua. Of course, this was refused, whereon
      the man asked roughly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By whose order?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As it happened, Maqueda, of whose presence he was not aware, heard him,
      and acting on some impulse, came forward, and unveiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By mine,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Know that the Child of Kings rules the Abati, not
      the Prince Joshua, and that prisoners taken by her soldiers are hers, not
      his. Be gone back to your post!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain stared, saluted, and went with his companions, not to the
      pass, indeed, as he had been ordered, but to Joshua. To him he reported
      the arrival of the Gentile&rsquo;s son, and the news he brought that the nation
      of the Fung, dismayed by the destruction of their god, were in full flight
      from the plains of Harmac, purposing to cross the great river and to
      return no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      This glad tidings spread like wildfire; so fast, indeed, that almost
      before we had begun our march, we heard the shouts of exultation with
      which it was received by the terrified mob gathered in the great square.
      The cloud of terror was suddenly lifted from them. They went mad in their
      delight; they lit bonfires, they drank, they feasted, they embraced each
      other and boasted of their bravery that had caused the mighty nation of
      the Fung to flee away for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, our advance had begun, nor in the midst of the general
      jubilation was any particular notice taken of us till we were in the
      middle of the square of Mur and within half a mile of the palace, when we
      saw by the moonlight that a large body of troops, two or three thousand of
      them, were drawn up in front of us, apparently to bar our way. Still we
      went on till a number of officers rode up, and addressing the commander of
      the regiment of Mountaineers, demanded to know why he had left his post,
      and whither he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I go whither I am ordered,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for there is one here greater
      than I.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you mean the Gentile Orme and his fellows, the command of the Prince
      Joshua is that you hand them over to us that they may make report to him
      of their doings this night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the command of the Child of Kings is,&rdquo; replied the captain of the
      Mountaineers, &ldquo;that I take them with her back to the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has no weight,&rdquo; said the spokesman insolently, &ldquo;not being endorsed by
      the Council. Surrender the Gentiles, hand over to us the person of the
      Child of Kings of whom you have taken possession, and return to your post
      till the pleasure of the Prince Joshua be known.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the wrath of Maqueda blazed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seize those men!&rdquo; she said, and it was done instantly. &ldquo;Now, cut the head
      from him who dared to demand the surrender of my person and of my
      officers, and give it to his companions to take back to the Prince Joshua
      as my answer to his message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man heard, and being a coward like all the Abati, flung himself upon
      his face before Maqueda, trying to kiss her robe and pleading for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dog!&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you were one of those who this very night dared to
      attack my chamber. Oh! lie not, I knew your voice and heard your
      fellow-traitors call you by your name. Away with him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We tried to interfere, but she would not listen, even to Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you plead for your brother&rsquo;s murderer?&rdquo; she asked, alluding to
      Quick. &ldquo;I have spoken!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they dragged him off behind us, and presently we saw a melancholy
      procession returning whence they came, carrying something on a shield. It
      reached the opposing ranks, whence there arose a murmur of wrath and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;March on!&rdquo; said Maqueda, &ldquo;and gain the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the regiment formed into a square, and, setting Maqueda and ourselves
      in the centre of it, advanced again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the fight began. Great numbers of the Abati surrounded us and, as
      they did not dare to make a direct attack, commenced shooting arrows,
      which killed and wounded a number of men. But the Highlanders also were
      archers, and carried stronger bows. The square was halted, the first ranks
      kneeling and the second standing behind them. Then, at a given word, the
      stiff bows which these hardy people used against the lion and the buffalo
      upon their hills were drawn to the ear and loosed again and again with
      terrible effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that open place it was almost impossible to miss the mobs of the Abati
      who, having no experience of war, were fighting without order. Nor could
      the light mail they wore withstand the rush of the heavy barbed arrows
      which pierced them through and through. In two minutes they began to give,
      in three they were flying back to their main body, those who were left of
      them, a huddled rout of men and horses. So the French must have fled
      before the terrible longbows of the English at Crécy and Poitiers, for, in
      fact, we were taking part in just such a mediæval battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, who was watching intently, went to Japhet and whispered something
      in his ear. He nodded and ran to seek the commander of the regiment.
      Presently the result of that whisper became apparent, for the sides of the
      hollow square wheeled outward and the rear moved up to strengthen the
      centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Mountaineers were ranged in a double or triple line, behind which
      were only about a dozen soldiers, who marched round Maqueda, holding their
      shields aloft in order to protect her from stray arrows. With these, too,
      came our four selves, a number of camp-followers and others, carrying on
      their shields those of the regiment who were too badly wounded to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the dead where they lay, we began to advance, pouring in volleys
      of arrows as we went. Twice the Abati tried to charge us, and twice those
      dreadful arrows drove them back. Then at the word of command, the
      Highlanders slung their bows upon their backs, drew their short swords,
      and in their turn charged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes afterwards everything was over. Joshua&rsquo;s soldiers threw down
      their arms, and ran or galloped to right and left, save a number of them
      who fled through the gates of the palace, which they had opened, and
      across the drawbridge into the courtyards within. After them, or, rather,
      mixed up with them, followed the Mountaineers, killing all whom they could
      find, for they were out of hand and would not listen to the commands of
      Maqueda and their officers, that they should show mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, just as the dawn broke this strange moonlit battle ended, a small
      affair, it is true, for there were only five hundred men engaged upon our
      side and three or four thousand on the other, yet one that cost a great
      number of lives and was the beginning of all the ruin that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we were safe for a while, since it was certain, after the lesson
      which he had just learned, that Joshua would not attempt to storm the
      double walls and fosse of the palace without long preparation. Yet even
      now a new trouble awaited us, for by some means, we never discovered how,
      that wing of the palace in which Maqueda&rsquo;s private rooms were situated
      suddenly burst into flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, I believe that the fire arose through the fact that a lamp had
      been left burning near the bed of the Child of Kings upon which was laid
      the body of Sergeant Quick. Perhaps a wounded man hidden there overturned
      the lamp; perhaps the draught blowing through the open doors brought the
      gold-spangled curtains into contact with the wick.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, the wood-panelled chambers took fire, and had it not happened
      that the set of the wind was favourable, the whole palace might have been
      consumed. As it was, we succeeded in confining the conflagration to this
      particular part of it, which within two hours had burnt out, leaving
      nothing standing but the stark, stone walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the funeral pyre of Sergeant Quick, a noble one, I thought to
      myself, as I watched it burn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the fire was so well under control, for we had pulled down the
      connecting passage where Higgs and Quick fought their great fight, that
      there was no longer any danger of its spreading, and the watches had been
      set, at length we got some rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda and two or three of her ladies, one of them, I remember, her old
      nurse who had brought her up, for her mother died at her birth, took
      possession of some empty rooms, of which there were many in the palace,
      while we lay, or rather fell, down in the guest-chambers, where we had
      always slept, and never opened our eyes again until the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      I remember that I woke thinking that I was the victim of some wonderful
      dream of mingled joy and tragedy. Oliver and Higgs were sleeping like
      logs, but my son Roderick, still dressed in his bridal robes, had risen
      and sat by my bed staring at me, a puzzled look upon his handsome face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you are here,&rdquo; I said, taking his hand. &ldquo;I thought I dreamed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Father,&rdquo; he answered in his odd English, &ldquo;no dream; all true. This is
      a strange world, Father. Look at me! For how many years&mdash;twelve&mdash;fourteen,
      slave of savage peoples for whom I sing, priest of Fung idol, always near
      death but never die. Then Sultan Barung take fancy to me, say I come of
      white blood and must be his daughter&rsquo;s husband. Then your brother Higgs
      made prisoner with me and tell me that you hunt me all these years. Then
      Higgs thrown to lions and you save him. Then yesterday I married to
      Sultan&rsquo;s daughter, whom I never see before but twice at fast of idol. Then
      Harmac&rsquo;s head fly off to heaven, and all Fung people run away, and I run
      too, and find you. Then battle, and many killed, and arrow scratch my neck
      but not hurt me,&rdquo; and he pointed to a graze just over his jugular vein,
      &ldquo;and now we together. Oh! Father, very strange world! I think there God
      somewhere who look after us!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, too, my boy,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;and I hope that He will continue
      to do so, for I tell you we are in a worse place than ever you were among
      the Fung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mind that, Father,&rdquo; he answered gaily, for Roderick is a
      cheerful soul. &ldquo;As Fung say, there no house without door, although plenty
      people made blind and can&rsquo;t see it. But we not blind, or we dead long ago.
      Find door by and by, but here come man to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man proved to be Japhet, who had been sent by the Child of Kings to
      summon us, as she had news to tell. So I woke the others, and after I had
      dressed the Professor&rsquo;s flesh wounds, which were stiff and sore, we joined
      her where she sat in the gateway tower of the inner wall. She greeted us
      rather sadly, asked Oliver how he had slept and Higgs if his cuts hurt
      him. Then she turned to my son, and congratulated him upon his wonderful
      escape and upon having found a father if he had lost a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;you are a fortunate man to be so well loved, O son of
      Adams. To how many sons are given fathers who for fourteen long years,
      abandoning all else, would search for them in peril of their lives,
      enduring slavery and blows and starvation and the desert&rsquo;s heat and cold
      for the sake of a long-lost face? Such faithfulness is that of my
      forefather David for his brother Jonathan, and such love it is that passes
      the love of women. See that you pay it back to him, and to his memory
      until the last hour of your life, child of Adams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, indeed, I will, O Walda Nagasta,&rdquo; answered Roderick, and throwing
      his arms about my neck he embraced me before them all. It is not too much
      to say that this kiss of filial devotion more than repaid me for all I had
      undergone for his beloved sake. For now I knew that I had not toiled and
      suffered for one of no worth, as is so often the lot of true hearts in
      this bitter world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then some of Maqueda&rsquo;s ladies brought food, and at her bidding we
      breakfasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sparing,&rdquo; she said with a melancholy little laugh, &ldquo;for I know not how
      long our store will last. Listen! I have received a last offer from my
      uncle Joshua. An arrow brought it&mdash;not a man; I think that no man
      would come lest his fate should be that of the traitor of yesterday,&rdquo; and
      she produced a slip of parchment that had been tied to the shaft of an
      arrow and, unfolding it, read as follows&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Walda Nagasta, deliver up to death the Gentiles who have bewitched you
      and led you to shed the blood of so many of your people, and with them the
      officers of the Mountaineers, and the rest shall be spared. You also I
      will forgive and make my wife. Resist, and all who cling to you shall be
      put to the sword, and to yourself I promise nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Written by order of the Council,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joshua, Prince of the Abati.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What answer shall I send?&rdquo; she asked, looking at us curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; replied Orme, shrugging his shoulders, &ldquo;if it were not for
      those faithful officers I am not sure but that you would be wise to accept
      the terms. We are cooped up here, but a few surrounded by thousands, who,
      if they dare not assault, still can starve us out, as this place is not
      victualled for a siege.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You forget one of those terms, O Oliver!&rdquo; she said slowly, pointing with
      her finger to the passage in the letter which stated that Joshua would
      make her his wife, &ldquo;Now do you still counsel surrender?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; he answered, flushing, and was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it does not matter what you counsel,&rdquo; she went on with a smile,
      &ldquo;seeing that I have already sent my answer, also by arrow. See, here is a
      copy of it,&rdquo; and she read&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To my rebellious People of the Abati:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surrender to me Joshua, my uncle, and the members of the Council who have
      lifted sword against me, to be dealt with according to the ancient law,
      and the rest of you shall go unharmed. Refuse, and I swear to you that
      before the night of the new moon has passed there shall be such woe in Mur
      as fell upon the city of David when the barbarian standards were set upon
      her walls. Such is the counsel that has come to me, the Child of Solomon,
      in the watches of the night, and I tell you that it is true. Do what you
      will, people of the Abati, or what you must, since your fate and ours are
      written. But be sure that in me and the Western lords lies your only hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Walda Nagasta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, O Maqueda,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;about the counsel that came to
      you in the watches of the night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I say, O Adams,&rdquo; she answered calmly. &ldquo;After we parted at dawn I
      slept heavily, and in my sleep a dark and royal woman stood before me whom
      I knew to be my great ancestress, the beloved of Solomon. She looked on me
      sadly, yet as I thought with love. Then she drew back, as it were, a
      curtain of thick cloud that hid the future and revealed to me the young
      moon riding the sky and beneath it Mur, a blackened ruin, her streets
      filled with dead. Yes, and she showed to me other things, though I may not
      tell them, which also shall come to pass, then held her hands over me as
      if in blessing, and was gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Hebrew prophet business! Very interesting,&rdquo; I heard Higgs mutter
      below his breath, while in my own heart I set the dream down to excitement
      and want of food. In fact, only two of us were impressed, my son very
      much, and Oliver a little, perhaps because everything Maqueda said was
      gospel to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubtless all will come to pass as you say, Walda Nagasta,&rdquo; said Roderick
      with conviction. &ldquo;The day of the Abati is finished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that, Son?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because, Father, among the Fung people from a child I have two offices,
      that of Singer to the God and that of Reader of Dreams. Oh! do not laugh.
      I can tell you many that have come true as I read them; thus the dream of
      Barung which I read to mean that the head of Harmac would come to Mur, and
      see, there it sit,&rdquo; and turning, he pointed through the doorway of the
      tower to the grim lion-head of the idol crouched upon the top of the
      precipice, watching Mur as a beast of prey watches the victim upon which
      it is about to spring. &ldquo;I know when dreams true and when dreams false; it
      my gift, like my voice. I know that this dream true, that all,&rdquo; and as he
      ceased speaking I saw his eyes catch Maqueda&rsquo;s, and a very curious glance
      pass between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Orme, he only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You Easterns are strange people, and if you believe a thing, Maqueda,
      there may be something in it. But you understand that this message of
      yours means war to the last, a very unequal war,&rdquo; and he looked at the
      hordes of the Abati gathering on the great square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered quietly, &ldquo;I understand, but however sore our straits,
      and however strange may seem the things that happen, have no fear of the
      end of that war, O my friends.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE BURNING OF THE PALACE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Orme was right. Maqueda&rsquo;s defiance did mean war, &ldquo;an unequal war.&rdquo; This
      was our position. We were shut up in a long range of buildings, of which
      one end had been burned, that on account of their moat and double wall, if
      defended with any vigour, could only be stormed by an enemy of great
      courage and determination, prepared to face a heavy sacrifice of life.
      This was a circumstance in our favour, since the Abati were not
      courageous, and very much disliked the idea of being killed, or even
      injured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But here our advantage ended. Deducting those whom we had lost on the
      previous night, the garrison only amounted to something over four hundred
      men, of whom about fifty were wounded, some of them dangerously. Moreover,
      ammunition was short, for they had shot away most of their arrows in the
      battle of the square, and we had no means of obtaining more. But, worst of
      all, the palace was not provisioned for a siege, and the mountaineers had
      with them only three days&rsquo; rations of sun-dried beef or goat&rsquo;s flesh, and
      a hard kind of biscuit made of Indian corn mixed with barley meal. Thus,
      as we saw from the beginning, unless we could manage to secure more food
      our case must soon grow hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
      There remained yet another danger. Although the palace itself was
      stone-built, its gilded domes and ornamental turrets were of timber, and
      therefore liable to be fired, as indeed had already happened. The roof
      also was of ancient cedar beams, thinly covered with concrete, while the
      interior containing an enormous quantity of panels, or rather boarding,
      cut from some resinous wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abati, on the other hand, were amply supplied with every kind of store
      and weapon, and could bring a great force to blockade us, though that
      force was composed of a timid and undisciplined rabble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we made the best preparations that we could, although of these I did
      not see much, since all that day my time was occupied in attending to the
      wounded with the help of my son and a few rough orderlies, whose
      experience in doctoring had for the most part been confined to cattle. A
      pitiful business it proved without the aid of anæsthetics or a proper
      supply of bandages and other appliances. Although my medicine chest had
      been furnished upon a liberal scale, it proved totally inadequate to the
      casualties of battle. Still I did my best and saved some lives, though
      many cases developed gangrene and slipped through my fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Higgs, who worked nobly, notwithstanding his flesh wounds, which
      pained him considerably, and Orme were also doing their best with the
      assistance of Japhet and the other officers of the highland regiment. The
      palace was thoroughly examined, and all weak places in its defences were
      made good. The available force was divided into watches and stationed to
      the best advantage. A number of men were set to work to manufacture arrow
      shafts from cedar beams, of which there were plenty in the wooden stables
      and outhouses that lay at the back of the main building, and to point and
      wing the same from a supply of iron barbs and feathers which fortunately
      was discovered in one of the guard-houses. A few horses that remained in a
      shed were killed and salted down for food, and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also every possible preparation was made to repel attempts to storm,
      paving stones being piled up to throw upon the heads of assailants and
      fires lighted on the walls to heat pitch and oil and water for the same
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to our disappointment, no direct assault was delivered, such
      desperate methods not commending themselves to the Abati. Their plan of
      attack was to take cover wherever they could, especially among the trees
      of the garden beyond the gates, and thence shoot arrows at any one who
      appeared upon the walls, or even fire them in volleys at the clouds, as
      the Normans did at Hastings, so that they might fall upon the heads of
      persons in the courtyards. Although these cautious tactics cost us several
      men, they had the advantage of furnishing us with a supply of ammunition
      which we sorely needed. All the spent arrows were carefully collected and
      made use of against the enemy, at whom we shot whenever opportunity
      offered. We did them but little damage, however, since they were extremely
      careful not to expose themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this fashion three dreary days went past, unrelieved by any incident
      except a feint, for it was scarcely more, which the Abati made upon the
      second night, apparently with the object of forcing the great gates under
      cover of a rainstorm. The advance was discovered at once, and repelled by
      two or three volleys of arrows and some rifle shots. Of these rifles,
      indeed, whereof we possessed about a score, the Abati were terribly
      afraid. Picking out some of the most intelligent soldiers we taught them
      how to handle our spare guns, and though, of course, their shooting was
      extremely erratic, the result of it, backed up by our own more accurate
      marksmanship, was to force the enemy to take cover. Indeed, after one or
      two experiences of the effect of bullets, not a man would show himself in
      the open within five hundred yards until night had fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third afternoon we held a council to determine what must be done,
      since for the last twenty-four hours it had been obvious that things could
      not continue as they were. To begin with, we had only sufficient food left
      to keep our force from starvation for two more days. Also the spirits of
      our soldiers, brave men enough when actual fighting was concerned, were
      beginning to flag in this atmosphere of inaction. Gathered into groups,
      they talked of their wives and children, and of what would happen to them
      at the hands of Joshua; also of their cattle and crops, saying that
      doubtless these were being ravaged and their houses burned. In vain did
      Maqueda promise them five-fold their loss when the war was ended, for
      evidently in their hearts they thought it could only end one way.
      Moreover, as they pointed out, she could not give them back their children
      if these were killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this melancholy council every possible plan was discussed, to find that
      these resolved themselves into two alternatives&mdash;to surrender, or to
      take the bull by the horns, sally out of the palace at night and attack
      Joshua. On the face of it, this latter scheme had the appearance of
      suicide, but, in fact, it was not so desperate as it seemed. The Abati
      being such cowards it was quite probable that they would run in their
      thousands before the onset of a few hundred determined men, and that, if
      once victory declared itself for the Child of Kings, the bulk of her
      subjects would return to their allegiance. So we settled on it in
      preference to surrender, which we knew meant death to ourselves, and for
      Maqueda a choice between that last grim solution of her troubles and a
      forced marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were others to be convinced, namely, the Mountaineers. Japhet,
      who had been present at the council, was sent to summon all of them except
      those actually on guard, and when they were assembled in the large inner
      court Maqueda went out and addressed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not remember the exact words of her speech, and I made no note of
      them, but it was extremely beautiful and touching. She pointed out her
      plight, and that we could halt no longer between two opinions, who must
      either fight or yield. For herself she said she did not care, since,
      although she was young and their ruler, she set no store upon her life,
      and would give it up gladly rather than be driven into a marriage which
      she considered shameful, and forced to pass beneath the yoke of traitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for us foreigners she did care. We had come to her country at her
      invitation, we had served her nobly, one of us had given his life to
      protect her person, and now, in violation of her safeguard and that of the
      Council, we were threatened with a dreadful death. Were they, her
      subjects, so lacking in honour and hospitality that they would suffer such
      a thing with no blow struck to save us?
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the majority of them shouted &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but some were silent, and one old
      captain advanced, saluted, and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Child of Kings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let us search out the truth of this matter. Is
      it not because of your love of the foreign soldier, Orme, that all this
      trouble has arisen? Is not that love unlawful according to our law, and
      are you not solemnly affianced to the Prince Joshua?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Maqueda considered awhile before she replied, and said slowly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend, my heart is my own, therefore upon this point answer your
      question for yourself. As regards my uncle Joshua, if there existed any
      abiding contract between us it was broken when a few nights ago he sent
      his servants armed to attack and drag me off I know not whither. Would you
      have me marry a traitor and a coward? I have spoken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; again shouted the majority of the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then in the silence that followed the old captain replied, with a
      canniness that was almost Scotch:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the point raised by you, O Child of Kings, I give no opinion, since
      you, being but a woman, if a high-born one, would not listen to me if I
      did, but will doubtless follow that heart of yours of which you speak to
      whatever end is appointed. Settle the matter with your betrothed Joshua as
      you will. But we also have a matter to settle with Joshua, who is a toad
      with a long tongue that if he seems slow yet never misses his fly. We took
      up your cause, and have killed a great number of his people, as he has
      killed some of ours. This he will not forget. Therefore it seems to me
      that it will be wise that we should make what we can of the nest that we
      have built, since it is better to die in battle than on the gallows. For
      this reason, then, since we can stay here no longer, for my part I am
      willing to go out and fight for you this night, although Joshua&rsquo;s people
      being so many and ours so few, I shall think myself fortunate if I live to
      see another sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This hard and reasoned speech seemed to appeal to the dissentients, with
      the result that they withdrew their opposition, and it was agreed that we
      should attempt to break our way through the besieging army about one hour
      before the dawn, when they would be heavily asleep and most liable to
      panic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, as it chanced, that sortie was destined never to take place, which
      perhaps was fortunate for us, since I am convinced that it would have
      ended in failure. It is true that we might have forced our way through
      Joshua&rsquo;s army, but afterwards those of us who remained alive would have
      been surrounded, starved out, and, when our strength and ammunition were
      exhausted taken prisoners or cut down.
    </p>
    <p>
      However that may be, events shaped a different course for us, perhaps
      because the Abati got wind of our intention and had no stomach for a
      pitched battle with desperate men. As it happened, this night from sunset
      on to moonrise was one of a darkness so remarkable that it was impossible
      to see anything even a foot away, also a wind blowing from the east made
      sounds very inaudible. Only a few of our men were on guard, since it was
      necessary that they should be rested till it was time for them to prepare
      for their great effort. Also, we had little fear of any direct attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      About eight o&rsquo;clock, however, my son Roderick, one of the watch stationed
      in the gateway towers, who was gifted with very quick ears, reported that
      he thought he heard people moving on the farther side of the massive
      wooden doors beyond the moat. Accordingly some of us went to listen, but
      could distinguish nothing, and concluded therefore that he was mistaken.
      So we retired to our posts and waited patiently for the moon to rise. But
      as it chanced no moon rose, or rather we could not see her, because the
      sky was completely covered by thick banks of thunder-clouds presaging the
      break-up of a period of great heat. These, as the wind had now died down,
      remained quite stationary upon the face of the sky, blotting out all
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps another hour had passed when, chancing to look behind me, I saw
      what I thought was a meteor falling from the crest of the cliff against
      which the palace was built, that cliff whither the head of the idol Harmac
      had been carried by the force of the explosion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look at that shooting star,&rdquo; I said to Oliver, who was at my side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a shooting star, it is fire,&rdquo; he replied in a startled voice,
      and, as he spoke, other streaks of light, scores of them, began to rain
      down from the brow of the cliff and land upon the wooden buildings to the
      rear of the palace that were dry as tinder with the drought, and, what was
      worse, upon the gilded timber domes of the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand the game?&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;They have tied firebrands to
      arrows and spears to burn us out. Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was done, and presently the great range of buildings began to hum like
      a hive of bees. The soldiers still half asleep, rushed hither and thither
      shouting. The officers also, developing the characteristic excitement of
      the Abati race in this hour of panic, yelled and screamed at them, beating
      them with their fists and swords till some kind of control was
      established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then attempts were made to extinguish the flames, which by this time had
      got hold in half-a-dozen places. From the beginning the effort was
      absolutely hopeless. It is true that there was plenty of water in the
      moat, which was fed by a perennial stream that flowed down the face of the
      precipice behind; but pumping engines of any sort were quite unknown to
      the Abati, who, if a building took fire, just let it burn, contenting
      themselves with safeguarding those in its neighbourhood. Moreover, even in
      the palace, such articles as pails, jugs, or other vessels were
      comparatively few and far between.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those that we could find, however, were filled with water and passed by
      lines of men to the places in most danger&mdash;that is, practically
      everywhere&mdash;while other men tried to cut off the advance of the
      flames by pulling down portions of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as fast as one fire was extinguished others broke out, for the rain of
      burning darts and of lighted pots or lamps filled with oil descended
      continuously from the cliff above. A strange and terrible sight it was to
      see them flashing down through the darkness, like the fiery darts that
      shall destroy the wicked in the day of Armageddon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, we toiled on despairingly. On the roof we four white men, and some
      soldiers under the command of Japhet, were pouring water on to several of
      the gilded domes, which now were well alight. Close by, wrapped in a dark
      cloak, and attended by some of her ladies, stood Maqueda. She was quite
      calm, although sundry burning arrows and spears, falling with great force
      from the cliff above, struck the flat roofs close to where she stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladies, however, were not calm. They wept and wrung their hands, while
      one of them went into violent hysterics in her very natural terror.
      Maqueda turned and bade them descend to the courtyard of the gateway,
      where she said she would join them presently. They rushed off, rejoicing
      to escape the sight of those burning arrows, one of which had just pierced
      a man and set his clothes and hair on fire, causing him to leap from the
      roof in his madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Oliver&rsquo;s request I ran to the Child of Kings to lead her to some safer
      place, if it could be found. But she would not stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me be, O Adams,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If I am to die, I will die here. But I do
      not think that is fated,&rdquo; and with her foot she kicked aside a burning
      spear that had struck the cement roof, and, rebounding, fallen quite close
      to her. &ldquo;If my people will not fight,&rdquo; she went on, with bitter sarcasm,
      &ldquo;at least they understand the other arts of war, for this trick of theirs
      is clever. They are cruel also. Listen to them mocking us in the square.
      They ask whether we will roast alive or come out and have our throats cut.
      Oh!&rdquo; she went on, clenching her hands, &ldquo;oh! that I should have been born
      the head of such an accursed race. Let Sheol take them all, for in the day
      of their tribulation no finger will I lift to save them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, and down below, near the gateway, I heard
      some brute screaming, &ldquo;Pretty pigeons! Pretty pigeons, are your feathers
      singeing? Come then into our pie, pretty pigeons, pretty pigeons!&rdquo;
       followed by shouts of ribald laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it chanced it was this hound himself who went into the &ldquo;pie.&rdquo;
       Presently, when the flames were brighter, I saw him, in the midst of a
      crowd of his admirers, singing his foul song, another verse of it about
      Maqueda, which I will not repeat, and by good fortune managed to put a
      bullet through his head. It was not a bad shot considering the light and
      circumstances, and the only one I fired that night. I trust also that it
      will be the last I shall ever fire at any human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as I was about to leave Maqueda and return with her message to Orme,
      to the effect that she would not move, the final catastrophe occurred.
      Amongst the stables was a large shed filled with dry fodder for the palace
      horses and camels. Suddenly this burst into a mass of flame that spread in
      all directions. Then came the last, hideous panic. From every part of the
      palace, the Mountaineers, men and officers together, rushed down to the
      gateway. In a minute, with the single exception of Japhet, we four and
      Maqueda were left alone upon the roof, where we stood overwhelmed, not
      knowing what to do. We heard the drawbridge fall; we heard the great doors
      burst upon beneath the pressure of a mob of men; we heard a coarse voice&mdash;I
      thought it was that of Joshua&mdash;yell:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill whom you will, my children, but death to him who harms the Child of
      Kings. She is my spoil!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then followed terrible sights and sounds. The cunning Abati had stretched
      ropes outside the doors; it was the noise they made at this work which had
      reached Roderick&rsquo;s ears earlier during the darkness. The terrified
      soldiers, flying from the fire, stumbled and fell over these ropes, nor
      could they rise again because of those who pressed behind. What happened
      to them all I am sure I do not know, but doubtless many were crushed to
      death and many more killed by Joshua&rsquo;s men. I trust, however, that some of
      them escaped, since, compared to the rest of the Abati, they were as lions
      are to cats, although, like all their race, they lacked the stamina to
      fight an uphill game.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the commencement of this terrific scene that I shot the
      foul-mouthed singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have done that, old fellow,&rdquo; screamed Higgs in his high
      voice, striving to make himself heard above the tumult, &ldquo;as it will show
      those swine where we are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think they will look for us here, anyway,&rdquo; I answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we watched awhile in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Orme at length, taking Maqueda by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going, O Oliver?&rdquo; she asked, hanging back. &ldquo;Sooner will I
      burn than yield to Joshua.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to the cave city,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;we have nowhere else to go,
      and little time to lose. Four men with rifles can hold that place against
      a thousand. Come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I obey,&rdquo; she answered, bowing her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      We went down the stairway that led from the roof on which the inhabitants
      of the palace were accustomed to spend much of their day, and even to
      sleep in hot weather, as is common in the East. Another minute and we
      should have been too late. The fire from one of the domes had spread to
      the upper story, and was already appearing in little tongues of flame
      mingled with jets of black smoke through cracks in the crumbling partition
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact this wall fell in just as my son Roderick, the last of
      us, was passing down the stairs. With the curiosity of youth he had
      lingered for a few moments to watch the sad scene below, a delay which
      nearly cost him his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the ground floor we found ourselves out of immediate danger, since the
      fire was attacking this part of the palace from above and burning
      downward. We had even time to go to our respective sleeping-places and
      collect such of our possessions and valuables as we were able to carry.
      Fortunately, among other things, these included all our note-books, which
      to-day are of priceless value. Laden with these articles, we met again in
      the audience hall, which, although it was very hot, seemed as it had
      always been, a huge, empty place, whereof the roof, painted with stars,
      was supported upon thick cedar columns, each of them hewn from a single
      tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing down that splendid apartment, which an hour later had ceased to
      exist, lamps in hand, for these we had found time to fetch and light, we
      reached the mouth of the passage that led to the underground city without
      meeting a single human being.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had the Abati been a different race they could perfectly well have dashed
      in and made us prisoners, for the drawbridge was still intact. But their
      cowardice was our salvation, for they feared lest they should be trapped
      by the fire. So I think at least, but justice compels me to add that, on
      the spur of the moment, they may have found it impossible to clear the
      gateways of the mass of fallen or dead soldiers over which it would have
      been difficult to climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, at any rate, was the explanation that we heard afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached the mouth of the vast cave in perfect safety, and clambered
      through the little orifice which was left between the rocks rolled thither
      by the force of the explosion, or shaken down from the roof. This hole,
      for it was nothing more, we proceeded to stop with a few stones in such a
      fashion that it could not be forced without much toil and considerable
      noise, only leaving one little tortuous channel through which, if
      necessary, a man could creep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The labour of rock-carrying, in which even Maqueda shared, occupied our
      minds for awhile, and induced a kind of fictitious cheerfulness. But when
      it was done, and the chilly silence of that enormous cave, so striking in
      comparison with the roar of the flames and the hideous human tumult which
      we had left without, fell upon us like sudden cold and blinding night upon
      a wanderer in windy, sunlit mountains, all our excitement perished. In a
      flash, we understood our terrible position, we who had but escaped from
      the red fire to perish slowly in the black darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still we strove to keep our spirits as best we could. Leaving Higgs to
      watch the blocked passage, a somewhat superfluous task, since the fire
      without was our best watchman, the rest of us threaded our way up the
      cave, following the telephone wire which poor Quick had laid on the night
      of the blowing-up of the god Harmac, till we came to what had been our
      headquarters during the digging of the mine. Into the room which was
      Oliver&rsquo;s, whence we had escaped with so much difficulty after that event,
      we could not enter because of the transom that blocked the doorway. Still,
      there were plenty of others at hand in the old temple, although they were
      foul with the refuse of the bats that wheeled about us in thousands, for
      these creatures evidently had some unknown access to the open air. One of
      these rooms had served as our store-chamber, and after a few rough
      preparations we assigned it to Maqueda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends,&rdquo; she said, as she surveyed its darksome entrance, &ldquo;it looks like
      the door of a tomb. Well, in the tomb there is rest, and rest I must have.
      Leave me to sleep, who, were it not for you, O Oliver, would pray that I
      might never wake again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; she added passionately, before us all, for now in face of the last
      peril every false shame and wish to conceal the truth had left her; &ldquo;man,
      why were you born to bring woe upon my head and joy to my heart? Well,
      well, the joy outweighs the woe, and even if the angel who led you hither
      is named Azrael, still I shall bless him who has revealed to me my soul.
      Yet for you I weep, and if only your life could be spared to fulfil itself
      in happiness in the land that bore you, oh! for you I would gladly die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now Oliver, who seemed deeply moved, stepped to her and began to whisper
      into her ear, evidently making some proposal of which I think I can guess
      the nature. She listened to him, smiling sadly, and made a motion with her
      hand as though to thrust him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is nobly offered, but did I accept, through
      whatever universes I may wander, those who came after me would know me by
      my trail of blood, the blood of him who loved me. Perhaps, too, by that
      crime I should be separated from you for ever. Moreover, I tell you that
      though all seems black as this thick darkness, I believe that things will
      yet end well for you and me&mdash;in this world or another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then she was gone, leaving Orme staring after her like a man in a trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay they will,&rdquo; remarked Higgs <i>sotto voce</i> to me, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
      first-rate so far as they are concerned. But what I should jolly well like
      to know is how they are going to end for <i>us</i> who haven&rsquo;t got a
      charming lady to see us across the Styx.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t puzzle your brain over that,&rdquo; I answered gloomily, &ldquo;for I
      think there will soon be a few more skeletons in this beastly cave, that&rsquo;s
      all. Don&rsquo;t you see that those Abati will believe we are burned in the
      palace?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      STARVATION
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was right. The Abati did think that we had been burned. It never
      occurred to them that we might have escaped to the underground city. So at
      least I judged from the fact that they made no attempt to seek us there
      until they learned the truth in the fashion that I am about to describe.
      If anything, this safety from our enemies added to the trials of those
      hideous days and nights. Had there been assaults to repel and the
      excitement of striving against overwhelming odds, at any rate we should
      have found occupation for our minds and remaining energies.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there were none. By turns we listened at the mouth of the passage for
      the echo of footsteps that never came. Nothing came to break a silence so
      intense that at last our ears, craving for sound, magnified the soft
      flitter of the bats into a noise as of eagle&rsquo;s wings, till at last we
      spoke in whispers, because the full voice of man seemed to affront the
      solemn quietude, seemed intolerable to our nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet for the first day or two we found occupation of a sort. Of course our
      first need was to secure a supply of food, of which we had only a little
      originally laid up for our use in the chambers of the old temple, tinned
      meats that we had brought from London and so forth, now nearly all
      consumed. We remembered that Maqueda had told us of corn from her estates
      which was stored annually in pits to provide against the possibility of a
      siege of Mur, and asked her where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She led us to a place where round stone covers with rings attached to them
      were let into the floor of the cave, not unlike those which stop the
      coal-shoots in a town pavement, only larger. With great difficulty we
      prised one of these up; to me it did not seem to have been moved since the
      ancient kings ruled in Mur and, after leaving it open for a long while for
      the air within to purify, lowered Roderick by a rope we had to report its
      contents. Next moment we heard him saying: &ldquo;Want to come up, please. This
      place is not pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We pulled him out and asked what he had found.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing good to eat,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;only plenty of dead bones and one rat
      that ran up my leg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We tried the next two pits with the same result&mdash;they were full of
      human bones. Then we cross-examined Maqueda, who, after reflection,
      informed us that she now remembered that about five generations before a
      great plague had fallen on Mur, which reduced its population by one-half.
      She had heard, also, that those stricken with the plague were driven into
      the underground city in order that they might not infect the others, and
      supposed that the bones we saw were their remains. This information caused
      us to close up those pits again in a great hurry, though really it did not
      matter whether we caught the plague or no.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, as she was sure that corn was buried somewhere, we went to another
      group of pits in a distant chamber, and opened the first one. This time
      our search was rewarded, to the extent that we found at the bottom of it
      some mouldering dust that years ago had been grain. The other pits, two of
      which had been sealed up within three years as the date upon the wax
      showed, were quite empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Maqueda understood what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely the Abati are a people of rogues,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;See now, the
      officers appointed to store away my corn which I gave them have stolen it!
      Oh! may they live to lack bread even more bitterly than we do to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We went back to our sleeping-place in silence. Well might we be silent,
      for of food we had only enough left for a single scanty meal. Water there
      was in plenty, but no food. When we had recovered a little from our
      horrible disappointment we consulted together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we could get through the mine tunnel,&rdquo; said Oliver, &ldquo;we might escape
      into the den of lions, which were probably all destroyed by the explosion,
      and so out into the open country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fung would take us there,&rdquo; suggested Higgs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; broke in Roderick, &ldquo;Fung all gone, or if they do, anything
      better than this black hole, yes, even my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us look,&rdquo; I said, and we started.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the passage that led from the city to the Tomb of Kings,
      it was to find that the wall at the end of it had been blown bodily back
      into the parent cave, leaving an opening through which we could walk side
      by side. Of course the contents of the tomb itself were scattered. In all
      directions lay bones, objects of gold and other metals, or overturned
      thrones. The roof and walls alone remained as they had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What vandalism!&rdquo; exclaimed Higgs, indignant even in his misery. &ldquo;Why
      wouldn&rsquo;t you let me move the things when I wanted to, Orme?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they would have thought that we were stealing them, old fellow.
      Also those Mountaineers were superstitious, and I did not want them to
      desert. But what does it matter, anyway? If you had, they would have been
      burned in the palace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time we had reached that end of the vast tomb where the
      hunchbacked king used to sit, and saw at once that our quest was vain. The
      tunnel which we had dug beyond was utterly choked with masses of fallen
      rock that we could never hope to move, even with the aid of explosives, of
      which we had none left.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we returned, our last hope gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also another trouble stared us in the face; our supply of the crude
      mineral oil which the Abati used for lighting purposes was beginning to
      run low. Measurement of what remained of the store laid up for our use
      while the mine was being made, revealed the fact that there was only
      enough left to supply four lamps for about three days and nights: one for
      Maqueda, one for ourselves, one for the watchman near the tunnel mouth,
      and one for general purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This general-purpose lamp, as a matter of fact, was mostly made use of by
      Higgs. Truly, he furnished a striking instance of the ruling passion
      strong in death. All through those days of starvation and utter misery,
      until he grew too weak and the oil gave out, he trudged backward and
      forward between the old temple and the Tomb of Kings carrying a large
      basket on his arm. Going out with this basket empty, he would bring it
      back filled with gold cups and other precious objects that he had
      collected from among the bones and scattered rubbish in the Tomb. These
      objects he laboriously catalogued in his pocket-book at night, and
      afterwards packed away in empty cases that had contained our supplies of
      explosive and other goods, carefully nailing them down when filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on earth are you doing that for, Higgs?&rdquo; I asked petulantly, as he
      finished off another case, I think it was his twentieth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Doctor,&rdquo; he answered in a thin voice, for like the rest of
      us he was growing feeble on a water-diet. &ldquo;I suppose it amuses me to think
      how jolly it would be to open all these boxes in my rooms in London after
      a first-rate dinner of fried sole and steak cut thick,&rdquo; and he smacked his
      poor, hungry lips. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;to take them out one by one
      and show them to &mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; and he mentioned by
      name officials of sundry great museums with whom he was at war, &ldquo;and see
      them tear their hair with rage and jealousy, while they wondered in their
      hearts if they could not manage to seize the lot for the Crown as
      treasure-trove, or do me out of them somehow,&rdquo; and he laughed a little in
      his old, pleasant fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I never shall,&rdquo; he added sadly, &ldquo;but perhaps one day some other
      fellow will find them here and get them to Europe, and if he is a decent
      chap, publish my notes and descriptions, of which I have put a duplicate
      in each box, and so make my name immortal. Well, I&rsquo;m off again. There are
      four more cases to fill before the oil gives out, and I must get that
      great gold head into one of them, though it is an awful job to carry it
      far at a time. Doctor, what disease is it that makes your legs suddenly
      give way beneath you, so that you find yourself sitting in a heap on the
      floor without knowing how you came there? You don&rsquo;t know? Well, no more do
      I, but I&rsquo;ve got it bad. I tell you I&rsquo;m downright sore behind from
      continual and unexpected contact with the rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Poor old Higgs! I did not like to tell him that his disease was
      starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he went on with his fetching and carrying and cataloguing and
      packing. I remember that the last load he brought in was the golden head
      he had spoken of, the wonderful likeness of some prehistoric king which
      has since excited so much interest throughout the world. The thing being
      too heavy for him to carry in his weakened state, for it is much over
      life-size, he was obliged to roll it before him, which accounts for the
      present somewhat damaged condition of the nose and semi-Egyptian diadem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never shall I forget the sight of the Professor as he appeared out of the
      darkness, shuffling along upon his knees where his garments were worn into
      holes, and by the feeble light of the lamp that he moved from time to
      time, painfully pushing the great yellow object forward, only a foot or
      two at each push.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is at last,&rdquo; he gasped triumphantly, whilst we watched him with
      indifferent eyes. &ldquo;Japhet, help me to wrap it up in the mat and lift it
      into the box. No, no, you donkey&mdash;face upward&mdash;so. Never mind
      the corners, I&rsquo;ll fill them with ring-money and other trifles,&rdquo; and out of
      his wide pockets he emptied a golden shower, amongst which he sifted
      handfuls of dust from the floor and anything else he could find to serve
      as packing, finally covering all with a goat&rsquo;s-hair blanket which he took
      from his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then very slowly he found the lid of the box and nailed it down, resting
      between every few strokes of the hammer whilst we watched him in our
      intent, but idle, fashion, wondering at the strange form of his madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the last nail was driven, and seated on the box he put his hand
      into an inner pocket to find his note-book, then incontinently fainted. I
      struggled to my feet and sprinkled water over his face till he revived and
      rolled on to the floor, where presently he sank into sleep or torpor. As
      he did so the first lamp gave out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light it, Japhet,&rdquo; said Maqueda, &ldquo;it is dark in this place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Child of Kings,&rdquo; answered the man, &ldquo;I would obey if I could, but there
      is no more oil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half-an-hour later the second lamp went out. By the light that remained we
      made such arrangements as we could, knowing that soon darkness would be on
      us. They were few and simple: the fetching of a jar or two of water, the
      placing of arms and ammunition to our hands, and the spreading out of some
      blankets on which to lie down side by side upon what I for one believed
      would be our bed of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we were thus engaged, Japhet crawled into our circle from the outer
      gloom. Suddenly I saw his haggard face appear, looking like that of a
      spirit rising from the grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lamp is burned out,&rdquo; he moaned; &ldquo;it began to fail whilst I was on
      watch at the tunnel mouth, and before I was half-way here it died
      altogether. Had it not been for the wire of the &lsquo;thing-that-speaks&rsquo; which
      guided me, I could never have reached you. I should have been lost in the
      darkness of the city and perished alone among the ghosts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are here now,&rdquo; said Oliver. &ldquo;Have you anything to report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, lord, or at least very little. I moved some of the small rocks
      that we piled up, and crept down the hole till I came to a place where the
      blessed light of day fell upon me, only one little ray of it, but still
      the light of day. I think that something has fallen upon the tunnel and
      broken it, perhaps one of the outer walls of the palace. At least I looked
      through a crack and saw everywhere ruins&mdash;ruins that still smoke.
      From among them I heard the voices of men shouting to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of them called to his companion that it was strange, if the Gentiles
      and the Child of Kings had perished in the fire, that they had not found
      their bones which would be known by the guns they carried. His friend
      answered that it was strange indeed, but being magicians, perhaps they had
      hidden away somewhere. For his part he hoped so, as then sooner or later
      they would be found and put to death slowly, as they deserved, who had led
      astray the Child of Kings and brought so many of the heaven-descended
      Abati to their death. Then fearing lest they should find and kill me, for
      they drew near as I could tell by their voices, I crept back again, and
      that is all my story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We said nothing; there seemed to be nothing to say, but sat in our sad
      circle and watched the dying lamp. When it began to flicker, leaping up
      and down like a thing alive, a sudden panic seized poor Japhet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Walda Nagasta,&rdquo; he cried, throwing himself at her feet, &ldquo;you have
      called me a brave man, but I am only brave where the sun and the stars
      shine. Here in the dark amongst so many angry spirits, and with hunger
      gnawing at my bowels, I am a great coward; Joshua himself is not such a
      coward as I. Let us go out into the light while there is yet time. Let us
      give ourselves up to the Prince. Perhaps he will be merciful and spare our
      lives, or at least he will spare yours, and if we die, it will be with the
      sun shining on us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Maqueda only shook her head, whereon he turned to Orme and went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, would you have the blood of the Child of Kings upon your hands? Is
      it thus that you repay her for her love? Lead her forth. No harm will come
      to her who otherwise must perish here in misery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hear what the man says, Maqueda?&rdquo; said Orme heavily. &ldquo;There is some
      truth in it. It really does not matter to us whether we die in the power
      of the Abati or here of starvation; in fact, I think that we should prefer
      the former end, and doubtless no hand will be laid on you. Will you go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she answered passionately. &ldquo;A hand would be laid on me, the hand of
      Joshua, and rather than that he should touch me I will die a hundred
      deaths. Let fate take its course, for as I have told you, I believe that
      then it will open to us some gate we cannot see. And if I believe in vain,
      why there is another gate which we can pass together, O Oliver, and beyond
      that gate lies peace. Bid the man be silent, or drive him away. Let him
      trouble me no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The lamp flame sank low. It flickered, once, twice, thrice, each time
      showing the pale, drawn faces of us six seated about it, like wizards
      making an incantation, like corpses in a tomb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then it went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long were we in that place after this? At least three whole days and
      nights, I believe, if not more, but of course we soon lost all count of
      time. At first we suffered agonies from famine, which we strove in vain to
      assuage with great draughts of water. No doubt these kept us alive, but
      even Higgs, who it may be remembered was a teetotaller, afterwards
      confessed to me that he has loathed the sight and taste of water ever
      since. Indeed he now drinks beer and wine like other people. It was
      torture; we could have eaten anything. In fact the Professor did manage to
      catch and eat a bat that got entangled in his red hair. He offered me a
      bite of it, I remember, and was most grateful when I declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it was also that we had a little food, a few hard ship&rsquo;s
      biscuits, which we had saved up for a purpose, namely, to feed Maqueda.
      This was how we managed it. At certain intervals I would announce that it
      was time to eat, and hand Maqueda her biscuit. Then we would all pretend
      to eat also, saying how much we felt refreshed by the food and how we
      longed for more, smacking our lips and biting on a piece of wood so that
      she could not help hearing us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This piteous farce went on for forty-eight hours or more until at last the
      wretched Japhet, who was quite demoralized and in no mood for acting,
      betrayed us, exactly how I cannot remember. After this Maqueda would touch
      nothing more, which did not greatly matter as there was only one biscuit
      left. I offered it to her, whereon she thanked me and all of us for our
      courtesy toward a woman, took the biscuit, and gave it to Japhet, who ate
      it like a wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time after this incident that we discovered Japhet to be
      missing; at least we could no longer touch him, nor did he answer when we
      called. Therefore, we concluded that he had crept away to die and, I am
      sorry to say, thought little more about it for, after all, what he
      suffered, or had suffered, we suffered also.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recall that before we were overtaken by the last sleep, a strange fit
      came upon us. Our pangs passed away, much as the pain does when
      mortification follows a wound, and with them that horrible craving for
      nutriment. We grew cheerful and talked a great deal. Thus Roderick gave me
      the entire history of the Fung people and of his life among them and other
      savage tribes. Further, he explained every secret detail of their idol
      worship to Higgs, who was enormously interested, and tried to make some
      notes by the aid of our few remaining matches. When even that subject was
      exhausted, he sang to us in his beautiful voice&mdash;English hymns and
      Arab songs. Oliver and Maqueda also chatted together quite gaily, for I
      heard them laughing, and gathered that he was engaged in trying to teach
      her English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last thing that I recollect is the scene as it was revealed by the
      momentary light of one of the last matches. Maqueda sat by Oliver. His arm
      was about her waist, her head rested upon his shoulder, her long hair
      flowed loose, her large and tender eyes stared from her white, wan face up
      toward his face, which was almost that of a mummy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then on the other side stood my son, supporting himself against the wall
      of the room, and beyond him Higgs, a shadow of his former self, feebly
      waving a pencil in the air and trying, apparently, to write a note upon
      his Panama straw hat, which he held in his left hand, as I suppose,
      imagining it to be his pocket-book. The incongruity of that sun-hat in a
      place where no sun had ever come made me laugh, and as the match went out
      I regretted that I had forgotten to look at his face to ascertain whether
      he was still wearing his smoked spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of a straw hat and smoked spectacles in kingdom-come?&rdquo; I
      kept repeating to myself, while Roderick, whose arm I knew was about me,
      seemed to answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Fung wizards say that the sphinx Harmac once wore a hat, but, my
      father, I do not know if he had spectacles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a sensation as of being whirled round and round in some vast machine,
      down the sloping sides of which I sank at last into a vortex of utter
      blackness, whereof I knew the name was death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimly, very dimly, I became aware that I was being carried. I heard voices
      in my ears, but what they said I could not understand. Then a feeling of
      light struck upon my eyeballs which gave me great pain. Agony ran all
      through me as it does through the limbs of one who is being brought back
      from death by drowning. After this something warm was poured down my
      throat, and I went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I awoke again it was to find myself in a large room that I did not
      know. I was lying on a bed, and by the light of sunrise which streamed
      through the window-places I saw the three others, my son Roderick, Orme
      and Higgs lying on the other beds, but they were still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abati servants entered the room bringing food, a kind of rough soup with
      pieces of meat in it of which they gave me a portion in a wooden bowl that
      I devoured greedily. Also they shook my companions until they awoke and
      almost automatically ate up the contents of similar bowls, after which
      they went to sleep again, as I did, thanking heaven that we were all still
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every few hours I had a vision of these men entering with the bowls of
      soup or porridge, until at last life and reason came back to me in
      earnest, and I saw Higgs sitting up on the bed opposite and staring at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are we alive, or is this Hades?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be Hades,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;because there are Abati here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;If the Abati go anywhere, it&rsquo;s to hell, where
      they haven&rsquo;t whitewashed walls and four-post beds. Oliver, wake up. We are
      out of that cave, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orme raised himself on his hand and stared at us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Maqueda?&rdquo; he asked, a question to which of course, we could give
      no answer, till presently Roderick woke also and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember something. They carried us all out of the cave; Japhet was
      with them. They took the Child of Kings one way and us another, that is
      all I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards the Abati servants arrived, bearing food more solid
      than the soup, and with them came one of their doctors, not that old idiot
      of a court physician, who examined us, and announced that we should all
      recover, a fact which we knew already. We asked many questions of him and
      the servants, but could get no answer, for evidently they were sworn to
      silence. However, we persuaded them to bring us water to wash in. It came,
      and with it a polished piece of metal, such as the Abati use for a
      looking-glass, in which we saw our faces, the terrible, wasted faces of
      those who have gone within a hair&rsquo;s breadth of death by starvation in the
      dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet although our gaolers would say nothing, something in their aspect told
      us that we were in sore peril of our lives. They looked at us hungrily, as
      a terrier looks at rats in a wire cage of which the door will presently be
      opened. Moreover, Roderick, who, as I think I have said, has very quick
      ears, overheard one of the attendants whisper to another:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When does our service on these hounds of Gentiles come to an end?&rdquo; to
      which his fellow answered, &ldquo;The Council has not yet decided, but I think
      to-morrow or the next day, if they are strong enough. It will be a great
      show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Also that evening, about sunset, we heard a mob shouting outside the
      barrack in which we were imprisoned, for that was its real use, &ldquo;Give us
      the Gentiles! Give us the Gentiles! We are tired of waiting,&rdquo; until at
      length some soldiers drove them away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, we talked the thing over, only to conclude that there was nothing to
      be done. We had no friend in the place except Maqueda, and she, it
      appeared, was a prisoner like ourselves, and therefore could not
      communicate with us. Nor could we see the slightest possibility of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out of the frying-pan into the fire,&rdquo; remarked Higgs gloomily. &ldquo;I wish
      now that they had let us die in the cave. It would have been better than
      being baited to death by a mob of Abati.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Oliver with a sigh, for he was thinking of Maqueda, &ldquo;but
      that&rsquo;s why they saved us, the vindictive beasts, to kill us for what they
      are pleased to call high treason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;High treason!&rdquo; exclaimed Higgs. &ldquo;I hope to goodness their punishment for
      the offence is not that of mediæval England; hanging is bad enough&mdash;but
      the rest&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the Abati study European history,&rdquo; I broke in; &ldquo;but it is
      no use disguising from you that they have methods of their own. Look here,
      friends,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;I have kept something about me in case the worst
      should come to the worst,&rdquo; and I produced a little bottle containing a
      particularly swift and deadly poison done up into tabloids, and gave one
      to each of them. &ldquo;My advice is,&rdquo; I added, &ldquo;that if you see we are going to
      be exposed to torture or to any dreadful form of death, you should take
      one of these, as I mean to do, and cheat the Abati of their vengeance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all very fine,&rdquo; said the Professor as he pocketed his tabloid,
      &ldquo;but I never could swallow a pill without water at the best of times, and
      I don&rsquo;t believe those beasts will give one any. Well, I suppose I must
      suck it, that&rsquo;s all. Oh! if only the luck would turn, if only the luck
      would turn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three more days went by without any sign of Higgs&rsquo;s aspiration being
      fulfilled. On the contrary, except in one respect, the luck remained
      steadily against us. The exception was that we got plenty to eat and
      consequently regained our normal state of health and strength more rapidly
      than might have been expected. With us it was literally a case of &ldquo;Let us
      eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only somehow I don&rsquo;t think that any of us really believed that we should
      die, though whether this was because we had all, except poor Quick,
      survived so much, or from a sneaking faith in Maqueda&rsquo;s optimistic dreams,
      I cannot say. At any rate we ate our food with appetite, took exercise in
      an inner yard of the prison, and strove to grow as strong as we could,
      feeling that soon we might need all our powers. Oliver was the most
      miserable among us, not for his own sake, but because, poor fellow, he was
      haunted with fears as to Maqueda and her fate, although of these he said
      little or nothing to us. On the other hand, my son Roderick was by far the
      most cheerful. He had lived for so many years upon the brink of death that
      this familiar gulf seemed to have no terrors for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All come right somehow, my father,&rdquo; he said airily. &ldquo;Who can know what
      happen? Perhaps Child of King drag us out of mud-hole, for after all she
      was very strong cow, or what you call it, heifer, and I think toss Joshua
      if he drive her into corner. Or perhaps other thing occur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What other thing, Roderick?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t know, can&rsquo;t say, but I think Fung thing. Believe we not done
      with Fung yet, believe they not run far. Believe they take thought for
      morrow and come back again. Only,&rdquo; he added sadly, &ldquo;hope my wife not come
      back, for that old girl too full of lofty temper for me. Still, cheer up,
      not dead yet by long day&rsquo;s march, and meanwhile food good and this very
      jolly rest after beastly underground city. Now I tell Professor some more
      stories about Fung religion, den of lions, and so forth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the morning after this conversation a crisis came. Just as we had
      finished breakfast the doors of our chamber were thrown open and in
      marched a number of soldiers wearing Joshua&rsquo;s badge. They were headed by
      an officer of his household, who commanded us to rise and follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; asked Orme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take your trial before the Child of Kings and her Council, Gentile,
      upon the charge of having murdered certain of her subjects,&rdquo; answered the
      officer sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Higgs with a sigh of relief. &ldquo;If Maqueda is
      chairman of the Bench we are pretty certain of an acquittal, for Orme&rsquo;s
      sake if not for our own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be too sure of that,&rdquo; I whispered into his ear. &ldquo;The
      circumstances are peculiar, and women have been known to change their
      minds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Adams,&rdquo; he replied, glaring at me through his smoked spectacles, &ldquo;If you
      talk like that we shall quarrel. Maqueda change her mind indeed! Why, it
      is an insult to suggest such a thing, and if you take my advice you won&rsquo;t
      let Oliver hear you. Don&rsquo;t you remember, man, that she&rsquo;s in love with
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I remember also that Prince Joshua is in love
      with her, and that she is his prisoner.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TRIAL AND AFTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      They set us in a line, four ragged-looking fellows, all of us with beards
      of various degrees of growth, that is, all the other three, for mine had
      been an established fact for years, and everything having been taken away
      from us, we possessed neither razor nor scissors.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the courtyard of our barrack we were met by a company of soldiers, who
      encircled us about with a triple line of men, as we thought to prevent any
      attempt of escape. So soon as we passed the gates I found, however, that
      this was done for a different reason, namely, to protect us from the fury
      of the populace. All the way from the barrack to the courthouse, whither
      we were being taken now that the palace was burned, the people were
      gathered in hundreds, literally howling for our blood. It was a strange,
      and, in a way, a dreadful sight to see even the brightly dressed women and
      children shaking their fists and spitting at us with faces distorted by
      hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why they love you so little, father, when you do so much for them?&rdquo; asked
      Roderick, shrugging his shoulders and dodging a stone that nearly hit him
      on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For two reasons,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;Because their Lady loves one of us too
      much, and because through us many of their people have lost their lives.
      Also they hate strangers, and are by nature cruel, like most cowards, and
      now that they have no more fear of the Fung, they think it will be safe to
      kill us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Roderick; &ldquo;yet Harmac has come to Mur,&rdquo; and he pointed to the
      great head of the idol seated on the cliff, &ldquo;and I think where Harmac
      goes, Fung follow, and if so they make them pay plenty for my life, for I
      great man among Fung; Fung myself husband of Sultan&rsquo;s daughter. These
      fools, like children, because they see no Fung, think there are no Fung.
      Well, in one year, or perhaps one month, they learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I daresay, my boy,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;but I am afraid that won&rsquo;t help us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By now we were approaching the court-house where the Abati priests and
      learned men tried civil and some criminal cases. Through a mob of nobles
      and soldiers who mocked us as we went, we were hustled into the large hall
      of judgment that was already full to overflowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the centre of it we marched to a clear space reserved for the parties
      to a cause, or prisoners and their advocates, beyond which, against the
      wall, were seats for the judges. These were five members of the Council,
      one of whom was Joshua, while in the centre as President of the Court, and
      wearing her veil and beautiful robes of ceremony, sat Maqueda herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, she&rsquo;s safe!&rdquo; muttered Oliver with a gasp of relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Higgs, &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s she doing there? She ought to be in the
      dock, too, not on the Bench.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We reached the open space, and were thrust by soldiers armed with swords
      to where we must stand, and although each of us bowed to her, I observed
      that Maqueda took not the slightest notice of our salutations. She only
      turned her head and said something to Joshua on her right, which caused
      him to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with startling suddenness the case began. A kind of public prosecutor
      stood forward and droned out the charge against us. It was that we, who
      were in the employ of the Abati, had traitorously taken advantage of our
      position as mercenary captains to stir up a civil war, in which many
      people had lost their lives, and some been actually murdered by ourselves
      and our companion who was dead. Moreover, that we had caused their palace
      to be burned and, greatest crime of all, had seized the sacred person of
      the Walda Nagasta, Rose of Mur, and dragged her away into the recesses of
      the underground city, whence she was only rescued by the chance of an
      accomplice of ours, one Japhet, betraying our hiding-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the charge which, it will be noted, contained no allusion
      whatever to the love entanglement between Maqueda and Oliver. When it was
      finished the prosecutor asked us what we pleaded, whereon Oliver answered
      as our spokesman that it was true there had been fighting and men killed,
      also that we had been driven into the cave, but as to all the rest the
      Child of Kings knew the truth, and must speak for us as she wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the audience began to shout, &ldquo;They plead guilty! Give them to death!&rdquo;
       and so forth, while the judges rising from their seats, gathered round
      Maqueda and consulted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By heaven! I believe she is going to give us away!&rdquo; exclaimed Higgs,
      whereon Oliver turned on him fiercely and bade him hold his tongue,
      adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you were anywhere else you should answer for that slander!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At length the consultation was finished; the judges resumed their seats,
      and Maqueda held up her hand. Thereon an intense silence fell upon the
      place. Then she began to speak in a cold, constrained voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentiles,&rdquo; she said, addressing us, &ldquo;you have pleaded guilty to the
      stirring up of civil war in Mur, and to the slaying of numbers of its
      people, facts of which there is no need for evidence, since many widows
      and fatherless children can testify to them to-day. Moreover, you did, as
      alleged by my officer, commit the crime of bearing off my person into the
      cave and keeping me there by force to be a hostage for your safety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We heard and gasped, Higgs ejaculating, &ldquo;Good gracious, what a lie!&rdquo; But
      none of the rest of us said anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For these offences,&rdquo; went on Maqueda, &ldquo;you are all of you justly worthy
      of a cruel death.&rdquo; Then she paused and added, &ldquo;Yet, as I have the power to
      do, I remit the sentence. I decree that this day you and all the goods
      that remain to you which have been found in the cave city, and elsewhere,
      together with camels for yourselves and your baggage, shall be driven from
      Mur, and that if any one of you returns hither, he shall without further
      trial be handed over to the executioners. This I do because at the
      beginning of your service a certain bargain was made with you, and
      although you have sinned so deeply I will not suffer that the glorious
      honour of the Abati people shall be tarnished even by the breath of
      suspicion. Get you gone, Wanderers, and let us see your faces no more for
      ever!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now the mob gathered in the hall shouted in exultation, though I heard
      some crying out, &ldquo;No, kill them! Kill them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the tumult had died down Maqueda spoke again saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O noble and generous Abati, you approve of this deed of mercy; you who
      would not be held merciless in far lands, O Abati, where, although you may
      not have heard of them, there are, I believe, other peoples who think
      themselves as great as you. You would not have it whispered, I say, that
      we who are the best of the world, we, the children of Solomon, have dealt
      harshly even with stray dogs that have wandered to our gates? Moreover, we
      called these dogs to hunt a certain beast for us, the lion-headed beast
      called Fung, and, to be just to them, they hunted well. Therefore spare
      them the noose, though they may have deserved it, and let them run hence
      with their bone, say you, the bone which they think that they have earned.
      What does a bone more or less matter to the rich Abati, if only their holy
      ground is not defiled with the blood of Gentile dogs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing at all! Nothing at all!&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;Tie it to their tails and
      let them go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It shall be done, O my people! And now that we have finished with these
      dogs, I have another word to say to you. You may have thought or heard
      that I was too fond of them, and especially of one of them,&rdquo; and she
      glanced toward Oliver. &ldquo;Well, there are certain dogs who will not work
      unless you pat them on the head. Therefore I patted this one on the head,
      since, after all, he is a clever dog who knows things that we do not know;
      for instance, how to destroy the idol of the Fung. O great Abati, can any
      of you really have believed that I, of the ancient race of Solomon and
      Sheba, I, the Child of Kings, purposed to give my noble hand to a vagrant
      Gentile come hither for hire? Can you really have believed that I, the
      solemnly betrothed to yonder Prince of Princes, Joshua, my uncle, would
      for a moment even in my heart have preferred to him such a man as that?&rdquo;
       And once again she looked at Oliver, who made a wild motion, as though he
      were about to speak. But before he could so much as open his lips Maqueda
      went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you believed, not guessing all the while I was working for the
      safety of my people, soon shall you be undeceived, since to-morrow night I
      invite you to the great ceremony of my nuptials, when, according to the
      ancient custom, I break the glass with him whom on the following night I
      take to be my husband,&rdquo; and rising, she bowed thrice to the audience, then
      stretched out her hand to Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, too, rose, puffing himself out like a great turkey-cock, and, taking
      her hand, kissed it, gobbling some words which we did not catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wild cheering followed, and in the momentary silence which followed Oliver
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady,&rdquo; he said, in a cold and bitter voice, &ldquo;we &lsquo;Gentiles&rsquo; have heard
      your words. We thank you for your kind acknowledgment of our services,
      namely, the destruction of the idol of the Fung at the cost of some risk
      and labour to ourselves. We thank you also for your generosity in allowing
      us, as the reward of that service, to depart from Mur, with insult and
      hard words, and such goods as remain to us, instead of consigning us to
      death by torture, as you and your Council have the power to do. It is
      indeed a proof of your generosity, and of that of the Abati people which
      we shall always remember and repeat in our own land, should we live to
      reach it. Also, we trust that it will come to the ears of the savage Fung,
      so that at length they may understand that true nobility and greatness lie
      not in brutal deeds of arms, but in the hearts of men. But now, Walda
      Nagasta, I have a last request to make of you, namely, that I may see your
      face once more to be sure that it is you who have spoken to us, and not
      another beneath your veil, and that if this be so, I may carry away with
      me a faithful picture of one so true to her country and noble to her
      guests as you have shown yourself this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She listened, then very slowly lifted her veil, revealing such a
      countenance as I had never seen before. It was Maqueda without a doubt,
      but Maqueda changed. Her face was pale, which was only to be expected
      after all she had gone through; her eyes glowed in it like coals, her lips
      were set. But it was her expression, at once defiant and agonized, which
      impressed me so much that I never shall forget it. I confess I could not
      read it in the least, but it left upon my mind the belief that she was a
      false woman, and yet ashamed of her own falsity. There was the greatest
      triumph of her art, that in those terrible circumstances she should still
      have succeeded in conveying to me, and to the hundreds of others who
      watched, this conviction of her own turpitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment her eyes met those of Orme, but although he searched them
      with pleading and despair in his glance, I could trace in hers no
      relenting sign, but only challenge not unmixed with mockery. Then with a
      short, hard laugh she let fall her veil again and turned to talk with
      Joshua. Oliver stood silent a little while, long enough for Higgs to
      whisper to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, isn&rsquo;t this downright awful? I&rsquo;d rather be back in the den of lions
      than live to see it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke I saw Oliver put his hand to where his revolver usually hung,
      but, of course, it had been taken from him. Next he began to search in his
      pocket, and finding that tabloid of poison which I had given him, lifted
      it toward his mouth. But just as it touched his lips, my son, who was next
      to him, saw also. With a quick motion he struck it from his fingers, and
      ground it to powder on the floor beneath his heel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver raised his arm as though to hit him, then without a sound fell
      senseless. Evidently Maqueda noted all this also, for I saw a kind of
      quiver go through her, and her hands gripped the arms of her chair till
      the knuckles showed white beneath the skin. But she only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Gentile has fainted because he is disappointed with his reward. Take
      him hence and let his companion, the Doctor Adams, attend to him. When he
      is recovered, conduct them all from Mur as I have decreed. See that they
      go unharmed, taking with them plenty of food lest it be said that we only
      spared their lives here in order that they might starve without our
      gates.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then waving her hand to show that the matter was done with, she rose and,
      followed by the judges and officers, left the court by some door behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she spoke a strong body of guards had surrounded us, some of whom
      came forward and lifted the senseless Oliver on to a stretcher. They
      carried him down the court, the rest of us following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; jeered the Abati as he passed, &ldquo;look at the Gentile pig who
      thought to wear the Bud of the Rose upon his bosom. He has got the thorn
      now, not the rose. Is the swine dead, think you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus they mocked him and us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We reached our prison in safety, and there I set to work to revive Oliver,
      a task in which I succeeded at length. When he had come to himself again
      he drank a cup of water, and said quite quietly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows have seen all, so there is no need for talk and explanations.
      One thing I beg of you, if you are any friends of mine, and it is that you
      will not reproach or even speak of Maqueda to me. Doubtless she had
      reasons for what she did; moreover, her bringing up has not been the same
      as ours, and her code is different. Do not let us judge her. I have been a
      great fool, that is all, and now I am paying for my folly, or, rather, I
      have paid. Come, let us have some dinner, for we don&rsquo;t know when we shall
      get another meal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We listened to this speech in silence, only I saw Roderick turn aside to
      hide a smile and wondered why he smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had we finished eating, or pretending to eat, when an officer
      entered the room and informed us roughly that it was time for us to be
      going. As he did so some attendants who had followed him threw us bundles
      of clothes, and with them four very beautiful camel-hair cloaks to protect
      us from the cold. With some of these garments we replaced our rags, for
      they were little more, tying them and the rest of the outfit up into
      bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, clothed as Abati of the upper class, we were taken to the gates of
      the barrack, where we found a long train of riding camels waiting for us.
      The moment that I saw these beasts I knew that they were the best in the
      whole land, and of very great value. Indeed, that to which Oliver was
      conducted was Maqueda&rsquo;s own favourite dromedary, which upon state
      occasions she sometimes rode instead of a horse. He recognized it at once,
      poor fellow, and coloured to the eyes at this unexpected mark of kindness,
      the only one she had vouchsafed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Gentiles,&rdquo; said the officer, &ldquo;and take count of your goods, that
      you may not say that we have stolen anything from you. Here are your
      firearms and all the ammunition that is left. These will be given to you
      at the foot of the pass, but not before, lest you should do more murder on
      the road. On those camels are fastened the boxes in which you brought up
      the magic fire. We found them in your quarters in the cave city, ready
      packed, but what they contain we neither know nor care. Full or empty,
      take them, they are yours. Those,&rdquo; and he pointed to two other beasts,
      &ldquo;are laden with your pay, which the Child of Kings sends to you,
      requesting that you will not count it till you reach Egypt or your own
      land, since she wishes no quarrelling with you as to the amount. The rest
      carry food for you to eat; also, there are two spare beasts. Now, mount
      and begone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So we climbed into the embroidered saddles of the kneeling dromedaries,
      and a few minutes later were riding through Mur toward the pass,
      accompanied by our guard and hooting mobs that once or twice became
      threatening, but were driven off by the soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say, Doctor,&rdquo; said Higgs to me excitedly, &ldquo;do you know that we have got
      all the best of the treasure of the Tomb of Kings in those five-and-twenty
      crates? I have thought since that I was crazy when I packed them, picking
      out the most valuable and rare articles with such care, and filling in the
      cracks with ring money and small curiosities, but now I see it was the
      inspiration of genius. My subliminal self knew what was going to happen,
      and was on the job, that&rsquo;s all. Oh, if only we can get it safe away, I
      shall not have played Daniel and been nearly starved to death for nothing.
      Why, I&rsquo;d go through it all again for that golden head alone. Shove on,
      shove on, before they change their minds; it seems too good to be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just then a rotten egg thrown by some sweet Abati youth landed full on the
      bridge of his nose, and dispersing itself into his mouth and over his
      smoked spectacles, cut short the Professor&rsquo;s eloquence, or rather changed
      its tenor. So absurd was the sight that in spite of myself I burst out
      laughing, and with that laugh felt my heart grow lighter, as though our
      clouds of trouble were lifting at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the mouth of the pass we found Joshua himself waiting for us, clad in
      all his finery and chain armour, and looking more like a porpoise on
      horseback than he had ever done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Farewell, Gentiles,&rdquo; he said, bowing to us in mockery, &ldquo;we wish you a
      quick journey to Sheol, or wherever such swine as you may go. Listen, you
      Orme. I have a message for you from the Walda Nagasta. It is that she is
      sorry she could not ask you to stop for her nuptial feast, which she would
      have done had she not been sure that, if you stayed, the people would have
      cut your throat, and she did not wish the holy soil of Mur to be defiled
      with your dog&rsquo;s blood. Also she bids me say that she hopes that your stay
      here will have taught you a lesson, and that in future you will not
      believe that every woman who makes use of you for her own ends is
      therefore a victim of your charms. To-morrow night and the night after, I
      pray you think of our happiness and drink a cup of wine to the Walda
      Nagasta and her husband. Come, will you not wish me joy, O Gentile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orme turned white as a sheet and gazed at him steadily. Then a strange
      look came into his grey eyes, almost a look of inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prince Joshua,&rdquo; he said in a very quiet voice, &ldquo;who knows what may happen
      before the sun rises thrice on Mur? All things that begin well do not end
      well, as I have learned, and as you also may live to learn. At least, soon
      or late, your day of reckoning must come, and you, too, may be betrayed as
      I have been. Rather should you ask me to forgive your soul the insults
      that in your hour of triumph you have not been ashamed to heap upon one
      who is powerless to avenge them,&rdquo; and he urged his camel past him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we followed I saw Joshua&rsquo;s face turn as pale as Oliver&rsquo;s had done, and
      his great round eyes protrude themselves like those of a fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; said the prince to his companions. &ldquo;Pray God he is
      not a prophet of evil. Even now I have a mind&mdash;no, let him go. To
      break my marriage vow might bring bad luck upon me. Let him go!&rdquo; and he
      glared after Oliver with fear and hatred written on his coarse features.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the last we ever saw of Joshua, uncle of Maqueda, and first
      prince among the Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the pass we went and through the various gates of the fortifications,
      which were thrown open as we came and closed behind us. We did not linger
      on that journey. Why should we when our guards were anxious to be rid of
      us and we of them? Indeed, so soon as the last gate was behind us, either
      from fear of the Fung or because they were in a hurry to return to share
      in the festivities of the approaching marriage, suddenly the Abati wheeled
      round, bade us farewell with a parting curse, and left us to our own
      devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, having roped the camels into a long line, we went on alone, truly
      thankful to be rid of them, and praying, every one of us, that never in
      this world or the next might we see the face or hear the voice of another
      Abati.
    </p>
    <p>
      We emerged on to the plain at the spot where months before we had held our
      conference with Barung, Sultan of the Fung, and where poor Quick had
      forced his camel on to Joshua&rsquo;s horse and dismounted that hero. Here we
      paused awhile to arrange our little caravan and arm ourselves with the
      rifles, revolvers, and cartridges which until now we had not been allowed
      to touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were but four of us to manage the long train of camels, so we were
      obliged to separate. Higgs and I went ahead, since I was best acquainted
      with the desert and the road, Oliver took the central station, and
      Roderick brought up the rear, because he was very keen of sight and
      hearing and from his long familiarity with them, knew how to drive camels
      that showed signs of obstinacy or a wish to turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our right lay the great city of Harmac. We noted that it seemed to be
      quite deserted. There, rebuilt now, frowned the gateway through which we
      had escaped from the Fung after we had blown so many of them to pieces,
      but beneath it none passed in or out. The town was empty, and although
      they were dead ripe the rich crops had not yet been reaped. Apparently the
      Fung people had now left the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we were opposite to the valley of Harmac, and saw that the huge sphinx
      still sat there as it had done for unknown thousands of years. Only its
      head was gone, for that had &ldquo;moved to Mur,&rdquo; and in its neck and shoulders
      appeared great clefts, caused by the terrific force of the explosion.
      Moreover, no sound came from the enclosures where the sacred lions used to
      be. Doubtless every one of them was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; suggested Higgs, whose archæological zeal was
      rekindling fast, &ldquo;that we might spare half-an-hour to go up the valley and
      have a look at Harmac from the outside? Of course, both Roderick and I are
      thoroughly acquainted with his inside, and the den of lions, and so forth,
      but I would give a great deal just to study the rest of him and take a few
      measurements. You know one must camp somewhere, and if we can&rsquo;t find the
      camera, at dawn one might make a sketch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you mad?&rdquo; I asked by way of answer, and Higgs collapsed, but to this
      hour he has never forgiven me.
    </p>
    <p>
      We looked our last upon Harmac, the god whose glory we had destroyed, and
      went on swiftly till darkness overtook us almost opposite to that ruined
      village where Shadrach had tried to poison the hound Pharaoh, which
      afterwards tore out his throat. Here we unloaded the camels, no light
      task, and camped, for near this spot there was water and a patch of maize
      on which the beasts could feed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the light quite faded Roderick rode forward for a little way to
      reconnoitre, and presently returned announcing shortly that he had seen no
      one. So we ate of the food with which the Abati had provided us, not
      without fear lest it should be poisoned, and then held a council of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was whether we should take the old road toward Egypt, or now
      that the swamps were dry, strike up northward by the other route of which
      Shadrach had told us. According to the map this should be shorter, and
      Higgs advocated it strongly, as I discovered afterwards because he thought
      there might be more archæological remains in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, on the other hand, was in favour of following the road we knew, which,
      although long and very wearisome, was comparatively safe, as in that vast
      desert there were few people to attack us, while Oliver, our captain,
      listened to all we had to say, and reserved his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, the question was settled for us by Roderick, who
      remarked that if we travelled to the north we should probably fall in with
      the Fung. I asked what he meant, and he replied that when he made his
      reconnaissance an hour or so before, although it was true that he had seen
      no one, not a thousand yards from where we sat he had come across the
      track of a great army. This army, from various indications, he felt sure
      was that of Barung, which had passed there within twelve hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps my wife with them, so I no want to go that way, father,&rdquo; he added
      with sincere simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where could they be travelling?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but think they go round to attack Mur from
      other side, or perhaps to find new land to north.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will stick to the old road,&rdquo; said Oliver briefly. &ldquo;Like Roderick I
      have had enough of all the inhabitants of this country. Now let us rest
      awhile; we need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      About two o&rsquo;clock we were up again and before it was dawn on the following
      morning we had loaded our camels and were on the road. By the first faint
      light we saw that what Roderick had told us was true. We were crossing the
      track of an army of many thousand men who had passed there recently with
      laden camels and horses. Moreover, those men were Fung, for we picked up
      some articles that could have belonged to no other people, such as a
      head-dress that had been lost or thrown away, and an arrow that had fallen
      from a quiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, we saw nothing of them, and, travelling fast, to our great relief
      by midday reached the river Ebur, which we crossed without difficulty, for
      it was now low. That night we camped in the forest-lands beyond, having
      all the afternoon marched up the rising ground at the foot of which ran
      the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward dawn Higgs, whose turn it was to watch the camels, came and woke
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to disturb you, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there is a most curious
      sky effect behind us which I thought you might like to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I rose and looked. In the clear, starlight night I could just discern the
      mighty outline of the mountains of Mur. Above them the firmament was
      suffused with a strange red glow. I formed my own conclusion at once, but
      only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us go to tell Orme,&rdquo; and led the way to where he had lain down under
      a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not sleeping; indeed, I do not think he had closed his eyes all
      night, the night of Maqueda&rsquo;s marriage. On the contrary, he was standing
      on a little knoll staring at the distant mountains and the glow above
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mur is on fire,&rdquo; he said solemnly. &ldquo;Oh, my God, Mur is on fire!&rdquo; and
      turning he walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Roderick joined us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fung got into Mur,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and now cut throat of all Abati. We well
      out of that, but pig Joshua have very warm wedding feast, because Barung
      hate Joshua who try to catch him not fairly, which he never forget; often
      talk of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor Maqueda!&rdquo; I said to Higgs, &ldquo;what will happen to her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but although once, like everybody else, I
      adored that girl, really as a matter of justice she deserves all she gets,
      the false-hearted little wretch. Still it is true,&rdquo; he added, relenting,
      &ldquo;she gave us very good camels, to say nothing of their loads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But I only repeated, &ldquo;Poor Maqueda!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day we made but a short journey, since we wished to rest ourselves
      and fill the camels before plunging into the wilderness, and feeling sure
      that we should not be pursued, had no cause to hurry. At night we camped
      in a little hollow by a stream that ran at the foot of a rise. As dawn
      broke we were awakened by the voice of Roderick, who was on watch, calling
      to us in tones of alarm to get up, as we were followed. We sprang to our
      feet, seizing our rifles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, there,&rdquo; he said, pointing toward the rise behind us.
    </p>
    <p>
      We ran round some intervening bushes and looked, to see upon its crest a
      solitary figure seated on a very tired horse, for it panted and its head
      drooped. This figure, which was entirely hidden in a long cloak with a
      hood, appeared to be watching our camp just as a spy might do. Higgs
      lifted his rifle and fired at it, but Oliver, who was standing by him,
      knocked the barrel up so that the bullet went high, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool. If it is only one man there&rsquo;s no need to shoot him, and
      if there are more you will bring them on to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the figure urged the weary horse and advanced slowly, and I noticed
      that it was very small. &ldquo;A boy,&rdquo; I thought to myself, &ldquo;who is bringing
      some message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rider reached us, and slipping from the horse, stood still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Oliver, scanning the cloaked form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One who brings a token to you, lord,&rdquo; was the answer, spoken in a low and
      muffled voice. &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; and a hand, a very delicate hand, was
      stretched out, holding between the fingers a ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew it at once; it was Sheba&rsquo;s ring which Maqueda had lent to me in
      proof of her good faith when I journeyed for help to England. This ring,
      it will be remembered, we returned to her with much ceremony at our first
      public audience. Oliver grew pale at the sight of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you come by this?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;Is she who alone may wear
      it dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; answered the voice, a feigned voice as I thought. &ldquo;The Child
      of Kings whom you knew is dead, and having no more need for this ancient
      symbol of her power, she bequeathed it to you whom she remembered kindly
      at the last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Oliver covered his face with his hands and turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; went on the speaker slowly, &ldquo;the woman Maqueda whom once it is said
      you loved&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He dropped his hands and stared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;the woman Maqueda whom once it is said you&mdash;loved&mdash;still
      lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the hood slipped back, and in the glow of the rising sun we saw the
      face beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was that of Maqueda herself!
    </p>
    <p>
      A silence followed that in its way was almost awful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord Oliver,&rdquo; asked Maqueda presently, &ldquo;do you accept my offering of
      Queen Sheba&rsquo;s ring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      NOTE BY MAQUEDA
    </p>
    <p>
      Once called Walda Nagasta and Takla Warda, that is, Child of Kings and Bud
      of the Rose, once also by birth Ruler of the Abati people, the Sons of
      Solomon and Sheba.
    </p>
    <p>
      I, Maqueda, write this by the command of Oliver, my lord, who desires that
      I should set out certain things in my own words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truly all men are fools, and the greatest of them is Oliver, my lord,
      though perhaps he is almost equalled by the learned man whom the Abati
      called Black Windows, and by the doctor, Son of Adam. Only he who is named
      Roderick, child of Adam, is somewhat less blind, because having been
      brought up among the Fung and other people of the desert, he has gathered
      a little wisdom. This I know because he has told me that he alone saw
      through my plan to save all their lives, but said nothing of it because he
      desired to escape from Mur, where certain death waited on him and his
      companions. Perhaps, however, he lies to please me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, for the truth of the matter, which not being skilled in writing I
      will tell briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was carried out of the cave city with my lord and the others, starving,
      starving, too weak to kill myself, which otherwise I would have done
      rather than fall into the hands of my accursed uncle, Joshua. Yet I was
      stronger than the rest, because as I have learned, they tricked me about
      those biscuits, pretending to eat when they were not eating, for which
      never will I forgive them. It was Japhet, a gallant man on one side, but a
      coward on the other like the rest of the Abati, who betrayed us, driven
      thereto by emptiness within, which, after all, is an ill enemy to fight.
      He went out and told Joshua where we lay hid, and then, of course, they
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they took away my lord and the others, and me too they bore to
      another place and fed me till my strength returned, and oh! how good was
      that honey which first I ate, for I could touch nothing else. When I was
      strong again came Prince Joshua to me and said, &ldquo;Now I have you in my net;
      now you are mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then I answered Joshua, &ldquo;Fool, your net is of air; I will fly through it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;By death,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;of which a hundred means lie to
      my hand. You have robbed me of one, but what does that matter when so many
      remain? I will go where you and your love cannot pursue me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Child of Kings,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but how about that tall Gentile who
      has caught your eyes, and his companions? They, too, have recovered, and
      they shall die every one of them after a certain fashion (which, I
      Maqueda, will not set down, since there are some things that ought not to
      be written). If you die, they die; as I told you, they die as a wolf dies
      that is caught by the shepherds; they die as a baboon dies that is caught
      by the husbandman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now I looked this way and that, and found that there was no escape. So I
      made a bargain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Joshua,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;let these men go and I swear upon the name of our
      mother, she of Sheba, that I will marry you. Keep them and kill them, and
      you will have none of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, in the end, because he desired me and the power that went with me,
      he consented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then I played my part. My lord and his companions were brought before me,
      and in presence of all the people I mocked them; I spat in their faces,
      and oh! fools, fools, fools, they believed me! I lifted my veil, and
      showed them my eyes, and they believed also what they seemed to see in my
      eyes, forgetting that I am a woman who can play a part at need. Yes, they
      forgot that there were others to deceive as well, all the Abati people,
      who, if they thought I tricked them, would have torn the foreigners limb
      from limb. That was my bitterest morsel, that I should have succeeded in
      making even my own lord believe that of all the wicked women that ever
      trod this world, I was the most vile. Yet I did so, and he cannot deny it,
      for often we have talked of this thing till he will hear of it no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they went with all that I could give them, though I knew well that
      my lord cared nothing, for what I could give, nor the doctor, Child of
      Adam, either, who cared only for his son that God had restored to him.
      Only Black Windows cared, not because he loves wealth, but because he
      worships all that is old and ugly, for of such things he fashions up his
      god.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, for their going was reported to me, and I, I entered into hell
      because I knew that my lord thought me false, and that he would never
      learn the truth, namely, that what I did I did to save his life, until at
      length he came to his own country, if ever he came there, and opened the
      chests of treasure, if ever he opened them, which perhaps he would not
      care to do. And all that while he would believe me the wife of Joshua, and&mdash;oh!
      I cannot write of it. And I, I should be dead; I, I could not tell him the
      truth until he joined me in that land of death, if there men and women can
      talk together any more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this and no other was the road that I had planned to walk. When he and
      his companions had gone so far that they could not be followed, then I
      would tell Joshua and the Abati all the truth in such language as should
      never be forgotten for generations, and kill myself before their eyes, so
      that Joshua might lack a wife and the Abati a Child of Kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I sat through the Feast of Preparation and smiled and smiled. It passed
      and the next day passed, and came the night of the Feast of Marriage. The
      glass was broken, the ceremony was fulfilled. Joshua rose up to pledge me
      before all the priests, lords, and headmen. He devoured me with his
      hateful eyes, me, who was already his. But I, I handled the knife in my
      robe, wishing, such was the rage in my heart, that I could kill him also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then God spoke, and the dream that I had dreamed came true. Far away there
      rose a single cry, and after it other cries, and the sounds of shouting
      and of marching feet. Far away tongues of fire leapt into the air, and
      each man asked his neighbour, &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; Then from all the thousands
      of the feasting people rose one giant scream, and that scream said, &ldquo;Fung!
      Fung! The Fung are on us! Fly, fly, fly!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; shouted Joshua, seizing me by the arm, but I drew my dagger on him
      and he let go. Then he fled with the other lords, and I remained in my
      high seat beneath the golden canopy alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people fled past me without fighting; they fled into the cave city,
      they fled to the rocks; they hid themselves among the precipices, and
      after them came the Fung, slaying and burning, till all Mur went up in
      flames. And I, I sat and watched, waiting till it was time for me to die
      also.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, I know not how long afterwards, appeared before me Barung, a red
      sword in his hand, which he lifted to me in salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Greeting, Child of Kings,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You see Harmac is come to sleep at
      Mur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;Harmac is come to sleep at Mur, and many of those who
      dwelt there sleep with him. What of it? Say, Barung, will you kill me, or
      shall I kill myself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Neither, Child of Kings,&rdquo; he answered in his high fashion. &ldquo;Did I not
      make you a promise yonder in the Pass of Mur, when I spoke with you and
      the Western men, and does a Fung Sultan break his word? I have taken back
      the city that was ours, as I swore to do, and purified it with fire,&rdquo; and
      he pointed to the raging flames. &ldquo;Now I will rebuild it, and you shall
      rule under me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;but in place of that promise I ask of you three
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Name them,&rdquo; said Barung.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are these: First, that you give me a good horse and five days&rsquo; food,
      and let me go where I will. Secondly, that if he still lives you advance
      one Japhet, a certain Mountaineer who befriended me and brought others to
      do likewise, to a place of honour under you. Thirdly, that you spare the
      rest of the Abati people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shall go whither you desire, and I think I know where you will go,&rdquo;
       answered Barung. &ldquo;Certain spies of mine last night saw four white men
      riding on fine camels towards Egypt, and reported it to me as I led my
      army to the secret pass that Harmac showed me, which you Abati could never
      find. But I said, &lsquo;Let them go; it is right that brave men who have been
      the mock of the Abati should be allowed their freedom.&rsquo; Yes, I said this,
      although one of them was my daughter&rsquo;s husband, or near to it. But she
      will have no more of him who fled to his father rather than with her, so
      it was best that he should go also, since, if I brought him back it must
      be to his death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I answered boldly, &ldquo;I go after the Western men; I who have done
      with these Abati. I wish to see new lands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And find an old love who thinks ill of you just now,&rdquo; he said, stroking
      his beard. &ldquo;Well, no wonder, for here has been a marriage feast. Say, what
      were you about to do, O Child of Kings? Take the fat Joshua to your
      breast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Barung, I was about to take <i>this</i> husband to my breast,&rdquo; and I
      showed him the knife that was hidden in my marriage robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;I think the knife was for Joshua first. Still,
      you are a brave woman who could save the life of him you love at the cost
      of your own. Yet, bethink you, Child of Kings, for many a generation your
      mothers have been queens, and under me you may still remain a queen. How
      will one whose blood has ruled so long endure to serve a Western man in a
      strange land?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I go to find out, Barung, and if I cannot endure, then I
      shall come back again, though not to rule the Abati, of whom I wash my
      hands for ever. Yet, Barung, my heart tells me I shall endure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Child of Kings has spoken,&rdquo; he said, bowing to me. &ldquo;My best horse
      awaits her, and five of my bravest guards shall ride with her to keep her
      safe till she sights the camp of the Western men. I say happy is he of
      them who was born to wear the sweet-scented Bud of the Rose upon his
      bosom. For the rest, the man Japhet is in my hands. He yielded himself to
      me who would not fight for his own people because of what they had done to
      his friends, the white men. Lastly, already I have given orders that the
      slaying should cease, since I need the Abati to be my slaves, they who are
      cowards, but cunning in many arts. Only one more man shall die,&rdquo; he added
      sternly, &ldquo;and that is Joshua, who would have taken me by a trick in the
      mouth of the pass. So plead not for him, for by the head of Harmac it is
      in vain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Now hearing this I did not plead, fearing lest I should anger Barung, and
      but waste my breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak I started on the horse, having with me the five Fung captains.
      As we crossed the marketplace I met those that remained alive of the
      Abati, being driven in hordes like beasts, to hear their doom. Among them
      was Prince Joshua, my uncle, whom a man led by a rope about his neck,
      while another man thrust him forward from behind, since Joshua knew that
      he went to his death and the road was one which he did not wish to travel.
      He saw me, and cast himself down upon the ground, crying to me to save
      him. I told him that I could not, though it is the truth, I swear it
      before God, that, notwithstanding all the evil he had worked toward me,
      toward Oliver my lord, and his companions, bringing to his end that
      gallant man who died to protect me, I would still have saved him if I
      could. But I could not, for although I tried once more, Barung would not
      listen. So I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plead, O Joshua, with him who has the power in Mur to-day, for I have
      none. You have fashioned your own fate, and must travel the road you
      chose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What road do you ride, mounted on a horse of the plains, Maqueda? Oh!
      what need is there for me to ask? You go to see that accursed Gentile whom
      I would I had killed by inches, as I would that I could kill you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then calling me by evil names, Joshua sprang at me as though to strike me
      down, but he who held the rope about his neck jerked him backward, so that
      he fell and I saw his face no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      But oh! it was sad, that journey across the great square, for the captive
      Abati by hundreds&mdash;men, women, and children together&mdash;with tears
      and lamentations cried to me to preserve them from death or slavery at the
      hands of the Fung. But I answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sins against me and the brave foreign men who fought so well for you
      I forgive, but search your hearts, O Abati, and say if you can forgive
      yourselves? If you had listened to me and to those whom I called in to
      help us, you might have beaten back the Fung, and remained free for ever.
      But you were cowards; you would not learn to bear arms like men, you would
      not even watch your mountain walls, and soon or late the people who refuse
      to be ready to fight must fall and become the servants of those who are
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And now, my Oliver, I have no more to write, save that I am glad to have
      endured so many things, and thereby win the joy that is mine to-day. Not
      yet have I, Maqueda, wished to reign again in Mur, who have found another
      throne.
    </p>

&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
